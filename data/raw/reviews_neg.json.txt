the guns are so inconsistent , i cant build sometimes and if i can they can somehow shoot through it . building noises do not occur sometimes . when i first land and pick up a gun it acts as if im holding an invisible pick axe , very good game <emoji>
join the pubg master race
i have been playing since the first day , and i still get on fortnite every day . people dont understand that they are hating on a free to play game and complaining about the current metta . <emoji>
epic games does not know how to handle a game . everything is unbalanced and stuff that needs to be nerfed gets buffed and everything that needs to be buffed gets nerfed . and . this game is mostly on luck . not skill
worst game i have ever played
the game suddenly freezes your character when in battle every now and then , then your dead . fix this issue and multiple others . this game is broken and the people who play are just annoying . well your just playing your game and you have all good loot you might just come across a bush camper or someone using a double pump the most broken thing ever . pump do alot of damage but there are those times where you hit a guy for <num> damage and he one shots you . sooooo many problems must be fixed in order for a decent game . sorry epic , i love your games and all but theres just something about this one that gets me . <emoji> oh and lower the vbucks prices <num> $ for <num> thing is disappointing . now i come back and update this after <num> weeks and its just disappointing . i have friends i play with me we all have the same glitch where we cant pull out our gun ! its annoying ! when im landing and some other player decides to land next to me i pick up my weapon try to pull it out , nothing happens . im done .
guns are broken he graphics are terrible the skins are useless just delet the game the will never bring playground if so im reporting it
ahhhhhh . why . straight copy of ddlc ! ginger gunner is sayori like y ? also in titled towers u can actully see sayori dead ! yuri always gets her fire ball jutsu and kills u ! she then fricken eats your wepons ! in moisty mire monika always gets her keyblade and beats u toooooo death ! natsuki is always watching fullmetal alchy ! and says manga is love manga is life ! nuuuuuuu ! monika has magic penis power and kills ! im done they ruined ddlc ! <emoji> <emoji>
updated <num> start of april ( <num> months after release) now and it still gets <num> stars . they just keep adding more stuff to the game that no one wants and has no use . they should be fixing prior issues and problems not adding more come on . the gun play is getting better but still just rushers with shotguns <num> of the time . all these rifles and never a chance to use them lol . they also continue to mess up the game every update they put out . <num> step forward <num> steps back . they clearly want money with their overpriced cosmetics . i mean seriously $ <num> $ <num> for just <num> skin ! wow . if epic put more time into solving game issues and not pumping out battle passes and overpriced skins then maybe ill give them more stars . untill then nope .
were do i start ? this game is garbage riddled with microtransactions and dosnt even say anywere on the xbox version that its going to be free to play in a couple months . tutorial is about <num> hours long , yes hours . its way too easy and building a fort is basically useless because you can just throw a couple walls up and be fine and you dont get your recources back at the end of the game . not to mention it takes forever grinding for those recources . do not buy this game it sucks and you will regret it
the crafting part of the game is ridiculous and is not needed and the game looks like a cartoon ! you shoot someone and all of a sudden thier building a huge and tall fort ! i dont get it !
this game is for autistic babies with nothing to do but waste their college funds on nothing more but virtual trash , so stop buying virgin bucks and get outside . reminder it rips off the pubg .
i like winnning i also like the <num> percent accuracy . also you only hate it because your trash
the game is complete trash . poor player base and mechanics .
good game but servers are horrible
they need to stop updating battle royalefake pubg and start working on save the world
give us everything for free
game is full of scrubs and <num> year olds . i wish i could have rated this game <num> stars . i played while waiting for pubg to come out and ill never go back . i hope that metor wipes out the entire game and not just tilted towers .
i wanna love this game . its so much fun . but epic wtf . this is such a poorly developed game it gives me the runs . srsly stop adding and fix this game plz for the love of gods . honestly <num> star game from a <num> star company . oh btw the game should run better after a maintenance . and yet every time they fix something the game runs worse . trash trash trash . epic games can eat a . well you get it .
i had <num> armor and <num> health and died by <num> bullet to the chest
i am autistic but i still like this game
with minimum microtransactions consistent updates fortnite is free to play if you chose but skill gap is a problem personally but practice makes perfect
before you mark this unhelpful , let me explain . this is the most laggy game i have ever played , the lag is worse than cod running off of mcdonalds wifi , also you could find the best assualt rifle in a matter of minutes or it could take you ten minutes to just to find a pistol , my point is , this game has way to many luck factors in it . and please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions . if you fixed the game like this , i would give the game four out of five stars . update , jan <num> , still garbage , the game has gotten much worse , the silenced pistol is way overpowered , you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone . also , shotguns are still overpowered lower their damage . i tryed pubg and at least that game has balanced health and weapon damage plus there are no shield potions to be found in pubg update jan <num> lag is fixed so heres <num> stars shotguns are still way overpowered , i have no more room left so <emoji>
great shooting , i love unlimited sprint , cool crafting mechanics , single ques , duos , and team ques , although . some lagfps hiccups & some minor bugs . imo this is the best battle royale on consoles rn . <emoji>
this game is one of the best games ive played in quite a while and its not even finished i genuinely cant wait for its full free release in <num> .
never got a chance to play bc the wont launch . pubg doesnt have these issues . fortnite !
the best battle royale game ever pubg sucks and fortnite rules <emoji>
it may be just like pubg but i think its better <emoji> , the cartoon look is amazing <emoji> ‍ <emoji> but not only that because they keep updates regularly so you always have something to look forward to <emoji> , they also added building and i think the building is one of the best things about this game , the game is still in beta so its fine with some glitching , they just need to make it less luck base <emoji> , but other than that great game epic games one of the greatest games so far ⚔
garbage laggy as hell plus i got a <num> damage with a blue pump from point blank then got <num> shot by a green pump . please learn how guns work irl and fix your poopy gun logics <emoji>
i always get double triple quad or quint
not fun and impossible to win
dont like the dab or that fact of friendships being destroyed ? how could epic games go from gears to this trash ?
you play stupid game get nothing but stupid rank also stupid is little kids begging thier parents to buy stupid costumes and stupid emotes stupid game its just stupid too many updates
(edit : gameroffaith <num> pls read carefully b <num> u send me comments again . nowhere in this rant did i say fortnight stole the battle royale genre from pubg . pubg didnt invent that genre h <num> z <num> did . ) drop in spawn , eye of the storm ? pubg u just gonna let a rich company that came up with the unreal engine and gears of war screw u by dropping their game first on console and for free , loaded with microtransactions ? lawsuit is surely needed . for those <num> yr old to <num> yr olds who force there parents to support this free to play garbage foff . this is a careless ripoff of what pubg has founded not the battle royale genre but the drop in spawn and the forced movement of the eye of the storm . sad to see a rich huge company like epic games result to stealing ideas from at the time a indie company , but sadder to see people back this stealing from a much smaller francise ! this cant be supported by gamers . u r helping a rich company fattin their pockets by screwing the little guy . <emoji>
so the people of india cant play fortnite on xbox ? common xbox and epic games i bought the console to play fortnite . you guys ruined all the excitement its a great game and i am not getting to play it since i live in india i hope you will fix this problem
i cant wait for this game . but i really hope you put in . difficulty modes . to make the game really hard .
this game will never die <emoji>
fun <num> . <num> of the time <emoji>
why do people not like this game
game is fun for <num> day then its just me landing and dying . do not waste time to download . also the only way to get vbucks is to pay for them which is over priced or pay a stupid amount for an add on save the world . game abselute crap
dis game doo doo nah jk love it keep it up epic
when u realize your original pve game is trash and got no sales so u gotta copy pubg .
put aside the bugs , glitches , and lag ts a great game . i love playing this with my friends even if <num> of the time we lose . all of the <num> year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop , as this game deserves at least <num> . <num> stars . the shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know , as well as some other serious problems like stw scammers and lag . if you are under <num> years of age you probably shouldnt play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some <num> year old tryhard , so for the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are <num> or older . try to not think about the glitches and other cons , and just have fun . i also highly recommend buying save the world , but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed . great game , <num> stars from me .
i love the game i just want save the world for free
this game sucks so much , i hope the creators die by a gunshot to there ugly mf face , pubg is gonna kill this cartoonish game , dont play this game its filled with degenerate nerds who have big gay .
so i rush a kid with double green pump and each of my shots do <num> damage and all headshots . especially the lag makes it worse
man ! this game is great yes the v bucks are totally over priced but no said u have <num> buy them . those people who are all like fort nte sucks r just up set because they suck . the game is a great game its very unique <emoji> plus its free just try it if u dont like it delete . it <emoji>
hurry up with playground mode <emoji>
i like how its free and all but it makes it free so you can spend money in game kids get addicted to skins even though just sticking to default is fine and plus if you waste youre money on skins theres a chance you might be seen in combat so whats the point of buying it im here to say this game is trash and its my opinion
pubg is a way better game . for pc . fortnite is a <num> yo tryhard magnet . pubg is way more realistic and dosent have <num> yos breaking controllers and spamming a to jump fortnite is sht
keeps logging me out in the middle of matches . this game is trash
the game in itself is good , but it gets <num> much credit . the game has lag issues plus the whole game is <num> luck based . theres not much skill when someone has a purple ar that ends u in <num> shot compared <num> a green peashooter ar that takes <num> headshots <num> gun somebody down . plus the mapchest weapon drops r <num> consistent in some areas . there r plenty of skilled players in the game but almost everyone knows where the best loot chest r on the map . it makes the game <num> uneven . plus , this game is a squeaker paradise <emoji> .
does youre game have negative to ok reviews ? no problem ! instead of working on the base game , so every mission doesnt feel the same , just try to capitalize on pubgs popularity . <num> for fortnite <num> for battle royale .
the graphics and i dont like is that you cannot change your appearance of your character
epic screwed up bringing back skull trooper updating this game so much who agrees fortnite is dieing remember the old days like they show in the trailer who misses when building wasnt your biggest concern and rember whe all of you who played in season <num> how there was tac sub grey pump purple tac now its whoever canget to that scar i remember my first win when i bush camped and got that snipe and ended someone with a green ar near dusty depot they need to stop adding crap and repair dust and brind back that smg you won your first game with over at moisty or how you <num> pumped a sqaud with a grey pump i say bring back the good days
this game is trash i could watch old people try to suck their toes and get better gameplay than this heaping pile of trash
fortnite is laggier than subnautica . i get that its a big game and there are gonna be bugs , but the lag is unbearable . if you get to a building and you get a gun , you might encounter another player . that player might have a gun . if you want to kill the player , you will increase your chances of the kill if you fire first . but if lag comes in you might lose . the lag is issued by player , so it will hit you in short bursts .
this game is the cancer of the internet and will just end up like minecraft did its unfun to new players trying to play the game and other platforms have unfair advantages due to mobile haveing the option to see sound and pc has quicker aim it the most unfun game i have ever played and its just going to get worst even <num> year olds are playing the game might as well get the hole minecraft comunity over here then this game is cancer and is going to burn i can already see it now aus , fandoms , under age players every were so go ahead go play a game that you cant even play because a player is going to kill you before you even start and the game has already started to generate dank memes and and if you did win good for you your another loser without a life
i love this game every update adds better graphics and awesome weapons keep it up !
anyone who says this game is boring doesnt have enough intelligence to completely rock this game . its not just tower defend missions . this game has more game modes than overwatch . each map load contains different terrain which gives some really interesting defend builds . this keeps you on your crafting toes . if you play just five hours , than you still havent learned everything yet . honestly you were probably in the tutorial but you thought you were playing the game . i completed chapter <num> , which is huge , and get rewarded with more game types . makes me wonder if there will be even more to come to truly challenge the player on final chapter .
this game is very popular , but i dont see how doing the same thing over and over again is fun
also its to popular and overrated . <emoji> agree . <emoji> disagree
decent game though its a pubg rip off with major lag on servers . you die before ever knowing you are in a gun fight because of laggy servers .
i would say its a nice game for kids since its free , but it promotes unrealistic violence ! if you play this , please do us both a favor and block me because our mental state and capacity arent on the same level . chop some rocks to build yourself a fort , let it be your tomb✌
i need vbucks and refunds
well , it got great but since they decided to go <num> fps , its back to lagging . not to mention they expect you to play as good as a pc player with new cross platform play . try killing a pc player with the hardcore lag xbox . just ruined the game . now its not letting me enter the game . pubg is a better , i recommend it over this .
think you could add any more confusing menus , charts , webs and currencies ? update <num> . the introduction of the battle royale mode has considerably increased the playability of this game . the original game playing against zombies is still crap .
this game is for kids . freeplay has little rewards . building ruins combat . get pubg for real strategic combat
its not everything the internet hypes it to be . if this isnt your cup of tea then dont play it
i got this game because pubg was laggy and full of desync . i had heard better about this game . thats all wrong . if youre looking for battle royale just get pubg .
the amount of tryhards in this game makes it impossible to play for casuals or noobs like me , but it is possible to have fun . however , there is one thing wrong . they lock cool visual upgrades behind the battle passvbucks microtransactions . if you cantwont buy them , they will send annoying emails telling you to buy it .
this game is garbage it supposed to be so big and the best game but you cant play it with new update there never good loot and the players are hackers fix your epic this game is trash
having a smallish map with <num> people is ridiculous , along with this there are sometimes where you would land right in the beginning and walk into a house to see someone already in there with a shotgun that one shots you . this hasnt happened once or twice its like every <num> games you will have this problem . along with this the rng is very annoying , you could be at some place like anarcy acres where you can search a house to only get bullets and bandages but the other house gets a green shotgun , <num> white rifle and some grenades . furthermoreif you survivehe first <num> minutes , i hope you have fun running around trying to either find people to kill or some better gear . the only good feeling you can get is from winning everything else will be frustration . i hoped you liked this review overall if youre good at pvp then have at it . but if not then dont bother keeping this game in the storage in your xbox one . update : the game has become overrated and its minecraft survival games wguns
this game was running fine until just recently on the pve side , literally just lost all my inventory and ability to build stuff , the game lags every <num> seconds , every new daylag , new player joins lag , swarm of zombies lag , giving players xp boostlag , this game is a grinder it used to be fun for me but now its just unplayable
fix your broken game . <num> damage headshots face to face with a rare pump shotgun . you have to land at named areas to get good loot . i feel your hitpoints for gun damage is randomized . the graphics are decent , cosmetics are ok , overall gameplay is below average , and the theme for season <num> is lame . make <num> v <num> a standard game mode . overall , the game is pretty bad . the servers are . mw <num> has better servers than this game
gameplay is fun . when it works . servers crash ever other day and when they are up your game lobby will crash <num> of the way through . it is nice that when you log back in , not all is lost . no . instead of the rewards earned you get a level <num> chest with booty in it . so many times over . it truly is a huge waste of time .
the game is really laggy and glitchy .
i am not going to talk about how the game is broken , because we all know that . but when is save the world gonna be free ? and why do outfits cost <num> to <num> dollars ? i feel like it is just because they want more money for a ripoff of pubg . fun for a while but gets boring . rpg is op . shooting through walls is a new update . <num> star
this game is overrated as . the combat is and it ruined any chance of any new fps games having a good multiplayer .
really epic yesterday i was soo excited ill today i go online and my battle pass is gone if u can do it for me my account is jaleel swag boy all caps no numbers
i pretty much thought this game would be kinda fun to play after i played it for like an hour it sucked dick the map is too small its a pubg rip off and theres too many players in the match the guns are just horrible there just for tryhards and you cant even pick what you want your character to look like every players a dick and thats pretty much it from the game is a piece of and i hate it plus , you have to buy one the modes like what the hell are you angry money bastard so , please kill yourself & delete this game while youre at it you fag gut
i hate everything about this game everything in this game is op nerf everything stop people spamming tilted and also just make save the world free
only fun part is gliding around in the glider at the beginning looking at the view of the pretty island . chopping trees is cool and all to until somebody with a stupid gamertag ruins it all by shooting me . its . i am going back to farmville to grow plants in peace
the game is good but could you give free vbucks because i dont have any pls my name is washingb i on xbox pls send my vbucks like <num> vbucks pls
ive been wating for this game forever and it finally came out !
i hate ths game ! dont install it ! play playerunkowns battlegrounds .
the hype is not real .
gamers like it and dont like , so why not ? <emoji>
it is so fun i do not want pubg to sue epic games . if they do will we get are money back and i want epic games to updating the game because it is so friken fun .
i just waited <num> minutes . to say it failed then it wants me to wait another <num> no way in hell is that happening fix the game or better yet stop f it up . well i waited again and now it says <num> min
this game requires no skill , all luck . back then we had games like mw <num> and mw <num> . look what were stuck with now . i had more fun in <num> days playing blackout than in this minecraft generation game . good job epic <emoji>
ihave been playing fortnite for about a year , and lemme tell you , its amazing . the controls are easy to learn and whhen playing , the sreen is not crowded with info like a lot of some other pvp games . because the game is not close to being done , though , fn has frequent updates which make the gameplay smoother and better . some people complain of lag , but after a full year , i only encountered one laggy moment that lasted about <num> seconds . i highly recommend that you play this game and experience the awesome community , strategy , and fun gameplay . may you get the wins
its just a bad ripoff of pubg
how im finna get better if i get killed before i can practice ? add leagues
best free game on the market . pubg runs terrible and is boring . give this a try with friends and have fun .
this game gives me sleep paralysis from boredom , its the same process over and over
this game is not very good . it is rng , its mostly wandering , not very original , and is boring . oh yeah never has a sharp metal object been so pitiful . the games positives are occasionally being fun , it is satisfying to win , and you have nothing to lose cause its free . oh yeah i lag less in call of duty wwii
completely awful hit detection and imbalanced weapons . provides no unlockable content or reason to continue to play .
anyone who plays fortnite is a <num> yr old little kid
your system doesnt find my live account
this game is super addicting ! the graphics are perfect . everything is great but many things : <num> . lag , it doesnt happen often but when it happens it fks up your whole game , you cant shoot , it freezes , and the glitches are annoying . <num> . campaign isnt the greatest , dont waste money on it . <num> . battlepass switches to early <num> . party issues (disconnection , errors , lag , etc . ) <num> . <num> type of map <num> . innacurate damage <num> . vbucks are expensive (just like <num> k) <num> . reloading is slow <num> . people hack <num> . uncustomizable weapons <num> . servers are like <num> k <num> . updates are to frequent <num> . no firstperson option <num> . no enemy signal <num> . slurp juice , shotguns , and silenced pistols are overspawned <num> . to cheezy , not great elements used <num> . no vehicles . <num> . not much modes <num> . there should be an option for <num> or <num> people in a party <num> . no customizablecreator skins
every <num> in the reviews saying the game is trash are just mad cause they suck . epic has done an amazing job keeping this game balanced and they release something in the game thats broken or o . p . they quickly patch and balance it . keep it up epic . yall are always gonna have haters cause no matter how good some <num> is there is always some <num> better . so instead of taking the l like and going on with their lives , they get salty and blame it on epic
i did all this work just to get the game to see why my friends like it so much but i cant even access it on my laptop ridiculous
the game just freezes then boots you out
novel idea . frustrating game play with glitches in every aspect . time to delete again after <num> <num> <num> update .
kid cartoon trash . the boogie bomb need i say more . i play big boy games with my big boy pants on . if you think your good at pvp because of this game thats really sad .
title says it all , battlegrounds looked more interesting than this .
alway makes me wait an hour to <num> mins an rips me off when i bought the sarter pack only gave me <num> v bucks not <num> v bucks and always kicks me out of game
every time i have to deal with people that dont use their brains . its not even funny . when you only get teamed up with people that hardly use it or even use their eyes or ears . are you in there that feel ? but . something only . i dont like . is that ? i have to put all the time .
where are the free meme skins ?
get an ar and shoot someone in the back . all other guns are pea shooters . stealth not included .
it was advertised as an open world survival fort builder but its not its a mission based defence game where you constantly run out of ammo and farm materials for about <num> minutes before you start a mission . so if you are looking to throw away <num> dollars and waste a large amount of time this is the game for you .
too many teleporting cheaters and invisible traps , poor game in general do not recommend
best game ever all you haters are just trash at the game
i wish they did not add rocket launcher because people use them alot and it does alot of damage sometimes my game lags when people kill me with a rocket launcher <emoji>
trash physics doesnt work at all . this game is retarded .
its all pay to win . im not going to be one of those idiots who waste all of their money on skins . the whole game is formed around micro transactions . and then the community shames people for not wasting their all their money
building is awesome gets updated frequently and new weapons every few weeks and amazing skins save the world is my vbucks giver takes time and practice to get skilled at the game and map gets updated not like pubg with no campain and like other shooters not like fortnite most played game i played and if you think overwatch is fun muselk played it and is playing fortnite pubg no good skins if you think mouse is best with speed you can change sensitivity .
its good pugb sucks get good
i cant get in on pc
ok the loading screen takes forever to load it takes <num> : <num> go load thats longer than gta v ok now the lag like i havd really good wifi and i still lag its really bad lag like really bad ive died so much times of lag that its unbelieveable but anythin else the game is fine
its a good game but they have a lot of fixing to do . a shot gun to the face up close should be a instant kill not <num> damage especially if they have <num> sheld and heath . you have to shoot somebody in the head <num> times with a shotgun if they have <num> sheld and health witch is completely retar if your lucky its <num> shots and there dead other wise if they kill you and you see there heath most likey they have <num> health or lower . i dont know about you but when you shoot somebody in the head it should be an instant kill not <num> shots to the head with a shotgun later .
this game is pure honestly the servers never work and when your about to get a win you get some massive lag which is annoying because then you loose or die so honestly screw this retarded game
you can see the improvements , keep it up !
this game is not fun and a waste of space . the only reason im rating one star is because i cant rate zero stars !
well first off i just want to say i love this game ever since the fortnightmares update there hasnt been almost any lag . second of all fnbr is not in beta if you were to buy early access to the save the world your game would still be titled fnbr im not sure why though . all i know is fnbr is not in beta and it doesnt have much yet but its an amazing game . <num>
the game has little lag and you can tell the creators love their game but even still its the developers seem to want to cater to new players . shotguns were nerfed so that beginers wouldnt be killed as fast . materials are even harder to collect so that players dont have to worry about enemies outbuilding them . c <num> is very powerfull so that if you are getting outbuilt you can knock it all down and reset the playing field . smgs were buffed so that if you arent accurate at all you could still spray and pray . llamas were nerfed severely so that materials are harder to come by . rockets were removed from llamas and capped so that if you were a slow builder you didnt need to worry about an endless barage of rockets and according to rummors there is going to be a materials cap so that expert builders cant do as much . they are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side show . but its not all bad knews . you can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of <num> $ .
the game requires you to listen to your surroundings and keep a watchful eye out for other players . that wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for the amount of lag that comes with it . preventing sniper shots , sneak attacks , fair firefights . not to mention audio cuts that prevent you from hearing other players . there is also some poor damage consistency where you could use the same weapon as another , hit each other in the head but youll be the one to die and hell escape basically unharmed
so this just a kids version of pubg but it is a good game
everytime i start the game it crashes
a broken game shotgun dmgs glitch and do <num> dmg and loot system is broken
its straight garbage . minecraft is better than this !
i just got the ultimate deluxe edition and it wont even let me play now
any game where you can buy your rank instead of earning it through hours of grinding deserves negative stars .
its <num> : <num> am and istill cant access the game . im still hyped though .
it crashes on the loading screen when i try to start the game up it turns to black screen then takes me back to the home screen
this game is boring and based on luck . it gets on my nerves you shoulda put out save the world first . you developers need to work on stw more or this game will become pure ! im waiting (still) for save the world to be available for free for now <emoji> this game <emoji>
but the people hating , are playing the wrong mode . pvp is trash .
i hate playing the game by myself . because every time i get either double , triple , or quad teamed in solo ! it is so inferiating ! and if you are a starting player , it does not care the game will put you up against no lives ! other than that , good quality gameplay , and graphics .
take the new minigun out its not even fair when using it against others bases . this game is trash . how do you hit someone thats right in front of you for <num> health with a green pump . (the best gun it the game . )
fortnite is what you get if you combined pubg world style and combat , with minecrafts fun building , and overwatchs skins . except fortnite manages to make it all suck . i know its my opinion , but i dont believe this game deserves all the praise it got and is still getting .
i dont like the tier system and it sucks and the coomunity are justt trolls and just the whole game !
one of the best games out ! foget about pubg . fortnite willl change that trust
i like the game it is cool
in response to sarcha <num> , pubg is far better than fortnite . if something is hard to be good at then it means you need skill to be good at it . fortnite is easy because <num> of the players are middleschoolers who dont have anything better to do . pubg is better than fortnite <emoji>
so what this god damn game is telling me is that could have <num> hp and <num> sheild and the other can have <num> hp if i shoot him with a scar ith all my ammo they dont die and if they shoot me once with a lil pump i die this game needs another update and if you make it even worse im uninstalling <emoji>
this game has a life season , s <num> defaults , s <num> tryhards and defaults , s <num> defaults half tryhards end season , s <num> tryhards , s <num> tryhards and meta guns , s <num> ? in reality i just hope this game never exists and go normally life with other game now nobody touch or play other games and i hope s <num> is the last season ? cause this game cant live longer and thx for making and showing how this game grow from nobody knew to most popular game thank you epic . realbuckedcave <num>
this game is money hungy , its a copy of pubg and the fanbase is toxic ! its also unfair , i will be level <num> and be put a level <num> . they stole other peoples dances and called them their own , like best mates , the og was by marlen weeb but what do they do ? they steal it as if it were their own !
i love this game but , whenever me and my friend play and we are vs <num> more group , we lag out the game or lag out and get killed and this isnt the first time . i find it suspicious how this happens in the top <num> everytime and this has happened to friends also . update : this game is a really good game , devs always up to date slowly improving and i dont know why it has such bad ratings with a game that is very fun . also , dont complain . its <num> free : )
the shotgun needs to be capped at <num> damage while point blank . its mid rang damage needs to be reduced ! it makes no sense how a blue pump can do <num> damage from mid range !
dis game gave me de diabetes ! i dont like dat ! it has des trash skins and dey like be costing like <num> dollar ! i could get ur mum for an hour for dat ! anyway ! i hope u lik mah knowledge ! ill be dabing on ze haters . <emoji> i have one of those . litboi
pubg reigns superior this game is for children
i like the guns i don , t like the glitch
its one of the best things ive ever played . its given me something to do on xbox since destiny <num> is dead . btw this is better than destiny <num> .
im about to win but then it lags me off my teams building and i get shot by the enamy team
hopefully we would see playeruknowns battleground soon ! <emoji>
waiting in loading qeue for <num> min
this game has given me hours of fun and as a free game thats amazing . its good to have a game that all of my freinds can have easy access to and can play together . feels like im back in hs when we use to all play games together more often . with full cross platform , i can finally play with all of my friends no matter what platform they are playing on . thank you epic games !
although an unorigonal idea still much enjoyable . your first win feels amazing btw <emoji> <emoji> ⚔⚔⚔⚔ <emoji> <emoji> ♻
frame drops in the beginning of every fight , guns not balanced at all , map is to small for <num> players and seems like gun fights are random if you win or not . i will just hold out for pubg to drop .
stupid game no wonder it is free
the battlepass was not worth it
was able to play one game of battle royal then i quit out to watch youtube , then flash forward <num> hours and i launch the game , then <num> windows pop up , a were loading fortnite please wait , then it says cant download uninstall something else then try again , which is really frustrating as i have <num> gb free and the game itself has been installeddeleted many times as well as other stuff(gamesapps) but same experience every time . fix this problem please
i have <num> words this game sucks
you can just jump around people with a shotgun and kill them . pubg is the answer .
theres no skill involved with this game . you can spend <num> minutes looting then get sniped by someone who only has a shotgun even though you put put all your shots into them .
this game is total dumpster fire ! do not waste your gigs on this sorry excuse for a game ! it <num> ripped off pubg with a sleazy building mechanic with resources . the graphics are awful even for a cartoon styled game . free to play doesnt matter to me . they could pay me and i still would not download this . you could find better battle royale games on a phone than this . the map is way too small , bullets go all over the place , and the frame rate is dropping like tom brady drops balls . please dont bother getting this piece of garbage game and save up for pubg . you will thank me later .
very epic indeed and lots of ⚔⚔⚔⚔ but it crashes sometimes <emoji>
if you are a major buy in , youll love this game . personally it feels like you are nerfed otherwise . i despise , no , i loathe this game .
it says save the world will be free in <num> but its not . wtf
cant wait for this game it looks amazing
fortnite is the hottest game out but there are a few problems with this game . for example pumps does <num> damage up close and they also should fix the lagging problem other than that this is a really good game <emoji>
f this game str <num> up game is wack
this game is so bad that is a ripoff of pubg one game i got tea baged . this is a hateful game .
this game is amazing and i really dont see any bugs the shotguns do less damage than they used to but that is good because u havee to work for a kill the only bad thing is how muchh vbucks cost which is for cosmetics so it is not pay to win
there is no way to learn to play if you are allowed to be killed as soon as you hit the ground . how about giving time to find a weapon or creating a tutorial
the game keeps giving me an hour wait time before i get to play bullsht
you know that one dead bug in your screen door that you try to ignore , thats fortnite
do not get this game . it is pay to win and you will alway get instantly killed by someone with a shotgun or by a sniper you will never see .
ill put it in <num> wordsphrases modders , laggy , trick people for money
hi my fortnite dont work
its a shooty game and its a good game to become a school shooter
bait n switch with paid loot . early access is new marketing speak for paying to beta test . wait for the actual release and save your money . never again , epic . <emoji> holy crap what happened to the tower defense we paid for ?
love the fact that you can shoot threw wood how fun
all this game is , is a big money grab . it makes it free but makes it so that youll play it but makes it so that youll have to spend real money to get better things and this game is built on that . along with that this game has no original ideas and relys heavly on mirotransactions to thee point where you will spend lost of mony on this
this game was so much fun when i first got it ! i even purchased the $ <num> version . three days layer they appear tp have created a queue ! this was my go to game . now i wont touch it . <num> minute queue just to play is not okay ! i feel cheated at the highest level . if they remedy this i eill rate <num> star sincerely , destro
game is garbage . guns are trash and shotguns are <num> inconsistent , and the game is <num> luck based . also players are rotten and bad sports .
i love fortnite <emoji> ifeel like a pro player
this game is trash , get pubg instead .
i have been playing this for a pretty long time now and let me tell you , this game is awesome ! <num> players , last one standing wins ! even if you dont like the game , its free so you might as well try it . i love that you are able to build in battles , or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win . i also like the storm slowly going over the map , pushing in all the remaining players to one small area . i also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find . from rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge ! i also like the stuff that you can get loot from . you can get loot from hot air balloons , from the ground , or you can get loot from golden chests ! i most of all love the extra modes that they add in . my favorite is playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want ! what i dont really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get . overall , i think you should get it !
i used to hate this game a lot when it first came out . but know im liking the game im happy i gave it a second chance . i play this on pc its better but xbox its okay . i have played three seasons <num> , <num> and <num> and i have gotten better and its really fun . i love the changes that they made it make the game better and i do regret hating the game i would had the skull trooper and dark knight . <num> . <num> being a great game .
servers have <num> minute que at times just to log in , and thats just the volume from only preorder players . sometimes after the que , login fails , and restarts que from the beginning ! framrates drop hard at times , almost as if the game freezes . missions are recycled , after playing <num> + hours ive only come across <num> or <num> different mission types . overhyped and unpolished , which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game .
with so many problems you still add to the game and ignore the problems that come with what you bring
i am not a fan . i think its too much like pubg . it also gets boring . the only good part is the save the world and the cool loot lama .
i dont like the fact you require xbox live to play , on ps <num> you only require internet . microsoft is trying to be greedy and make more money (not like they dont have billions . )
this game is so friggin dope ! but just fix the clicheness and the fact i never find people because of that stupid double t tilted towers ! (also add a huge hikingbased mountain place called hikin haywire)
im sick of this where everytime i land somewhere i get killed because of lag , its not ok , and i dont know how you guys do it , but every season is worse than the last one
garbage . also its extremely pay <num> win , so if youre gonna play free , dont bother .
i dont even do reviews but they just obliterated pubg . its free , now plays in <num> fps , consistent updates and has a pve mode within the full game purchase . im gladly giving this game <num> stars for how far they have come in a such short amount of time . they fix bugs asap and actually deliver their product in a timely fashion . my god , i must say i am proud of you fortnite ! please keep up the good work . these triple aaa companies need to learn from the little guys and actually deliver quality like this in reasonable quantities . well done ! slow claps <emoji> download this and try it out . you wont be disappointed with the latest update . <num> <emoji>
it should not need xboxlive like ps <num>
i love this game <num> if you dont like it its cuz you cant aim or suck at building or your just trash ♻
they said we would be getting new content on a set date and then had to push it back cuz it was not ready . well i already took the day off and canceled my other plans . dont give us set dates unless you are <num> ready to do it on that date . and when you lie to us reward us . if ark lies to us they give double exp for a while and apologize . i deal with the crashes at the last minute of a hour long mission and then when i get back in i get little or no rewards for the mission . i deal with the pay as the only way to get good things . p <num> w . i do not like being lied to and then not rewarded . we didnt force you to give us the date . update jan so i paid <num> plus dollars for this game and now i am forced to wait <num> mins to log in queue because they let a whole bunch of pvpers have the game for free . i am a paying customer i shouldnt have to wait in line with the people who got it free .
this game is horrible ! you gave my son depression ! you crap load of s <emoji> it on my jimmys screen ! i wasted my money for brain <emoji> washing game ! u have brought my child toshoot others and he says lit when he kills someone irl <emoji>
broken garbage . words cant describe how this game . broken , tiered weapons . rewarded for luck this game takes <num> skill . building is dumb af . this is a childspoor mans battle royale . play pubg for a real game . not this f <num> p greed fest of a game . you want cool outfit have fun spending <num> $ on one outfit and another twenty for an axe lol you epic eat . ur game . the only reason people play this trash is because its free . nobody would buy this trash ever ! also fortnite wasnt a br game at first . now your team focuses <num> on br and said founders who supported this trash b <num> br . epic ill never support another game you make ever .
this is worse than infinite warfare do i have to say more !
such a bad game it gave me cancer
lags all the time bullets dont register such a cheap bs game
this game is fun but it could be better if i didnt go aginst teamers and try hard that will do anything to kill you if you could have people with epic accounts have skill matched players . most of the time i have played with starters who get insta killed in the start an also some new items are just random another way ou could fix the game if you make playground have more players like <num> so people can practice also i have been in alot of games where people team but dont get banned also this game is a scam
this game is nothing but a poor attempt to copy pubg in a cartoonish fashion . that needs to stop to give pu the rights to this type of game . that means take this game off xbl and sue epic
no gameplay variety at all !
incredibly disappointed in the bofa in every match . save your time and just play skyrim .
pvp : rng bullets ruins pvp . where do my bullets go ? pve : the lag is really bad at times , you can tell epic games is putting their effort in pvp only . we should call it paragon . skilled base players stay clear
do not see the appeal of battle royal games , all the cons of good games packed into one sh . t game . better than pubg , but thats not saying much . maybe i just dont get it because i dont eat tide pods .
the game has cheaters and bots dont play or you will lose money like me i lost <num> dollars i wanna to give to a friendly player but when i died to this bot player <num> i had <num> cent left i hate this game . i want my <num> dollars and my game fixed .
from worst to insanely terrible to their getaway update . they now have you getting rid of an item and make you grab the weapon instead of swapping , most of the weapons still suck , and the goddamn getaway mode ! it puts you in a smaller space and then you have to reach in the goddamn back of the goddamn van ! ladies and gentlemen , this has been crowned as the worst and broken br game in history . they shouldve stuck with the jackrabbit .
this game is the best ! <emoji> but their are some mistakes but this game is very addicting
it a really good game and i recommend it but some thing just dont make sense like the hit boxes are out rages and i shoot someone so many time they dont die they shoot me like three time with a pistol and i die and when i jump they shoot under me and still does damage like ok and mostly every thing about it . suuuuuck fixxxxx it the game is garbage pubg is better you game freaking sucks dude so i suggest you fix the game for the thousandth time
<emoji> supposed to be <num> star
how about you start charging for the game so you dont waste your time with your servers and spend more time making the game good
to prove it picture two people ne with a grey ar and one with a blue just installed who would win <num> of the time say something besides the blue ar your wrong
battle royale is just another lame pvp that only , and i mean only , rewards couch potatoes . if youre lucky enough to have some intelligent squad mates , you can still get jumped by someone who can snipe you with a shotgun from several blocks away (not kidding) . the pve story mode is ok , progression is slow but fun . the crafting and leveling systems are likely to drive anyone up a wall , theyre so unnecessarily complicated (doubt theyll ever fix that either but oh well) . if you have the patience , pve is worth the money . battle royale is not (and its free)
walk around a map for <num> minutes , only to have the strom or someone camping in a corner kill you , gameplay wise the aiming is awful , guns are inaccurate , loot system is completely messed . i do not understand why this game is popular
once pubg comes to xbox one this game will die
you get to kill people and i dont like it you die
its okay , but pubg is better
fortnite is a very good battle royale game . theres one thing i must point out however . i had just noticed that the epic tactical shotgun has been removed . please bring this gun back into fortnite : battle royale .
they said that on <num> save the will be for free but its a lie
pubg players triggered cuz their game on xbox is complete trash nd fortnite is doing everything right pubg is dead hello fortnite <emoji>
you will almost spend more time updating than you will be playing because it is constantly needing updated ! now im almost out of data .
fortnite used to be a good game . ever since fortnite blew up , epic got so greedy and started to focus on money and cosmetics over players . they stopped caring about the players a long time ago . and yet people still play it <num> . and the whole lucktowin factor is just to get more appeal from trash players so that theyll play and buy items . fortnite is just a moneygrab now .
the game is just a remake of pubg just animated and obliderated every other good game in existance and all people talk about .
purchased , wont load since month <num> , support wont help if needed ! calling for a refund today . <num> . smh i was so excited to play too .
i like theres a thing were u make yur own base and thats it
pubg killed this game , so it dumped this unplayable clone for free avoid . wait for the real thing
dont waste your time on this game , the weapons are so unbalanced that it either take <num> bullets to the chest kill one guy then <num> to the head to kill the next . the amount of modders are insane . i cant tell you how many times someone spawned a minigun out of nowhere as soon as we drop then destroy me . if you want my advice , go spend the $ <num> for pubg . my friend has it and its so much better .
the creators want money and nothing else
alice texas toast with peanut butter and chocolate milk please let me know if we have to work on my phone is it going today i am not in a good day i love that movie with you candy and chips please give me a phone
all u do is defend an atlas and this guys van . its terrible and doesnt deserve <num> . <num> whatsoever
terrible lag and gun damage
everything about this game sucks
when i land in a desserted place , i get killed from no where . plus this game sucks and playerunknowns battleground is better .
everyone is like talking a lot about this game everywhere and i cant wait to actually put my hands on such game . and best of all , its free to play !
the aiming system is horrible
was bouta get a dub with my boi clerf . he disconnected for no reason , later the game building does not work at . i died . frick fortnite .
i hate this game . the game is play to win , people who have the battle pass always win which gives them the upper advantage over other players . the in game store is so expensive , $ <num> for a player , pickaxe , and glider skin . dont get it because its really horrible .
im stoked ever since e <num> <num> showed gameplay
first off , this games just hopping on the battle royale band wagon . and second , the games hitboxes are so random that you cant even hit someone in the chest with a rifle when they are <num> feet away . edit : just replayed it for a while and it still sucks
its a copy of pubg the map is like <num> times smaller than pubg
played for about <num> hours and im already bored missions are to easy . zombie things wont hit you if you walk side to side and the constant freeze frame foor three seconds then coming back to getting hit is weak glad i only wasted <num> bucks . not impressed at all
but i cant seem to figure out how this is supposed to be fun .
its ok <emoji> , i mean , i won <num> times on this game yeah so i like this game
no incentives for winning , microtransaction city for cosmetics , play pubg unless your hard up for battle royal with rng aiming .
well , the game lags too much , the hitbox are broken , the range of weapons and their spread are also broken , i died so many times to hackers with wall , speed , and aimbot hacks . my advice ? wait until pubg gets released on the xbox one this year . dont play this overhype garbage .
second update . still cant log in after <num> weeks of owning nor can the servers access my purchased content . i cant believe i paid for ths game . stay away ! ive had this game since launch and this is the second time i havent been able to play a game that i paid a lot of money for ! this is not good . seems like their servers are constantly down . it wont log me into my epic account despite the fact ive already played this game a few times . this is garbage .
this is battle front <num> on steriods and its way trashier
save the world is good but the battle royale is a waste of money and time
edit : harry <num> x <num> & its other bf supreme gmb got triggered by my comment lmfao dude <emoji> proves my point all the more that this game just another pos that will be dead soon cause they over hype the crap out of it . its just a quick buck for em . like overwatch . one thing dose alright everyones gotta make their ow n verson . pretty much like that can i copy your homework meme fortnite : can i copy your homework ? h <num> z <num> , pubg , ect . yeah , just change it so it doesnt look like you copied . free & still dead meme
thats all there is to be said
this game was designed for brads and chads .
the game is good for the price it is at right now($ <num> . <num> ) . there are many things that are limited compared to the pc version . for example you can not download any mods or skins . you are able to buy skins but that just makes it feel like the normal console edition for xbox . one thing that really bothers me though is the fact that you can not look at your coordinates . this can be very frustrating especially if you are big into building and mining . for the price ($ <num> . <num> ) it is a good buy , but once the price goes back up and it is the same as the pc edition ($ <num> . <num> ) i would suggest just getting the pc edition instead
as someone whos played minecraft for pc since it was in beta (the java version) , im not quite sure how i feel about this game . when this was first released , it was pe all over again , and something i wouldnt have wanted to play . now though , this and pe have been advanced leaps and bounds over what they were a year ago , and to my knowledge , this game has suddenly gotten a lot of what was missing before . that said , its still unmoddable and continues to be behind the java counterpart for releases . since im reviewing on a pc with a mouse and keyboard , my review might be biased , but i think this app is a waste for pc users . if youre using a surface on the go or a w <num> phone , this app is the only way youll be able to play , at which point i recommend getting it . if youre a pc user , i would recommend investing more into the java version at minecraft . net .
fantastic addition to the minecraft library . simple interface and controls .
i think i would enjoy this game a lot more if i could play it . at the moment it cant even download . so can it please be fixed asap !
diese version macht riesige fortschritte und wird bald die java edition einüberholen .
fantastic game yet full of glitches . every update brings more and more glitches . fix the glitches already ! im tired of wiping my progress and starting over to get rid of the glitches . if you cant take care of game problems then you shouldnt be charging for it . note : glitches keep persisting now for over a year . have not been fixed .
the game is beautifully designed and programmed , just like the other minecraft versions ive played . all its missing is that glorious map , xd but other than that it is an awesome game and very addicting
has a very similar layout to the original pc edition , and it is compatible with pe . i can now play on my laptop with people on tablets . thank you ! there are only a few bugs i have noticed so far . i cannot activate nether portals except for flat worlds , once i turned off xbox live multiplayer , i cannot turn it back on . also , an offline mode should be added so i can play when i am not connected to a wifi network other than that , this is a job well done !
gives me the trial unless i open through ms store . not always connected to the internet so this is a problem , please fix .
this is literally just minecraft : pocket edition with a few touchups . the control options in the settings still have lefty and split controls which do nothing , as they are designed for a touchscreen phone . this is meant to be played on a pc , so why would you port a smartphone game onto it instead ? just take the old java version and change it so itll be able to run on windows <num> , because this is not worth it .
i have purchased this game already , yet everytime i open it i must click buy minecraft and access the internet . i am given an error user already owns message and then i am given access . this requires me to have access to the internet to play the game , which , as a truck drive , i do not always have available to me . help me fix this and its an easy <num> star
i can play with my kids on their non windows tablets , please keep it that way ! (until windows store gets basic games they will always have those)
would probably be any better on a larger screen (tv) ? you can really pass time fast with this and after being in the hospital for almost three years this helps many daily blues until i can get back home ! thanks so much .
i left a review months ago complaining about how i paid for coins and i didnt get them , but that doesnt matter anymore because i cant update the game and i have to purchase it again for me to do that . everytime i try to view the game on the windows store , it crashes and exits the store . it wants me to purchase the game again , although i had already purchased it . please help me because i cant play the game , and it bothers me . im not sure if its something wrong with my account or my billing info or if its the store , but please help me .
where is the aquatic update the fish and stuff . why donti have it ! plz : ( im part swedish can you help a brother out ? i would be so much happier with it and i would stop sending you messages . give it to me ! thank you i have it now : )
has a lot of the exact same bugs that are in the java version . pros : very well optimised unlike its java counterpart . biomes are a lot larger and smoother . cons : has horse armour but no horses . very limited graphical options . cant change keyboard bindings , but can change controller bindings . villages and pyramids are very common (found <num> pyramids and <num> villages in my first hour , one desert) . inventory mouse doesnt centre on open , can toss items within the inventory ui , and some pickup glitches . random short bursts of sprinting while walking . no trading with villagers . doesnt tie to any single java update , a lot of features and mechanics are all over the place . not allowed to use community texture packs , only storebought . although it runs well , it seems to be more catered to xbox phone rather than pc . im not really a big fan of how this version is going . the only thing that excited me about it was optimisation , which has always been needed .
this game is fun i love it im just soo addicted : )
i have seen so many posts about this being different than java or posts like (cliffs large differences post) about it looking like it was remade rather than ported . well no duh if you were a programmer or honestly had the slightest clue about computers you would know there is a difference in programming languages . java is based and built from c++ however it isnt c++ nor as powerful at the low levels that c++ can be . this is indeed being remade , however it has a baseline they are recoding it in c++ from the original java source code base . this takes time and some revamping on some procedures , methods and classs . that being said the c++ version (windows <num> ) is far superior in performance or at the very least will be when it is all finished . currently it is still beta with features being added . this takes time to redo the entire codebase were talking millions of lines of code in fact at least <num> more than the original java version . also they are coding for virtual reality systems too .
i like everything i dont like they dont have cars please add cars !
i open the game(it freezes for about <num> sec) then i see couple options . i click on play expecting it to take me to the create world screen . except the game freezes . i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work . i tried everything but it still does not work .
been able to play the game until the update came out . enjoyed every bit of it until then . now that the update came out the update will not get past . <num> kb of the update . waited for over <num> hours and no progress please help .
ovo je najbolja igrica na svijetu !
i bought this version expecting everything from the java edition but i was totally wrong . this version doesnt support any other servers , mods , or addons . it ridiculous and its the same price as the java edition . if i were you id buy the java edition because it comes with the windows <num> edition for free . also if you were wondering you dont get the java edition for free when you buy this which is so incredulously ridiculous i cant even begin to type about it or id get so pissed i might die .
it just reminds me of a old pocket edition version .
pendapat saya mengenai minecraft windows <num> edition ini merupakan versi paling sempurna karena kinerja yang baik ketika dijalankan pada perangkat computer dengan spek yang kecil . minecraft windows <num> edition ini sangat cocok untuk kamu yang ingin bermain minecraft dengan tampilan yang halus , ringan , dan grafik yang lebih bagus jika dibandingkan dengan versi lainnya .
great to play with my friends all over the world
really good game thats challenging and great for passing time
this version might seem pretty useless since you can get minecraft pc on windows , but there are a ton of cool features this has that pc doesnt have ! the main feature would be the crossplay this has with pocket edition , so you can play with yours friends who have the mobile version of the game . you can also get this version of minecraft for free if you own pc minecraft , which is pretty cool . overall its an amazing game . one of the best apps on the windows store . keep up the good work , mojang ! : d
i cant update ! and if i cant update i cant pay with my friends ! what the mojang ?
crossplatform between console and pc still isnt here and their is a lack of meaningful updates . stick to the java version , its far better .
this is literally the pocket edition on pc , just spend the extra $ <num> on the real pc version cause this verion is multiple updates behind and is locked at <num> fps .
the game seems to run on cpu only , completely ignoring the gpu . it saturates <num> threads on brand new intel chip , yet the performance is awful at <num> .
i love the game . its easy to download . but i cant change the way im looking on the key board . i am always looking at myself . also , i cant make my own skin . : ( its ok
yesterday ive downloaded this for free with my code and i was having fun with it but for some reason today i tried opening the app and it woldnt work it just stayed in the mojang symbol , than i tried looking at task manager and noticed that minecraft was in background app not a app someone please help ! also someone else having the problem that the you see the loading screen and you cant even find the install button and the loading symbols just stays there doing nothing ? its happening to me in all the apps please help me ! (i tried reinstalling minecraft btw)
this game is a lot of fun but it does lack in some spaces like the creative menu .
this is a great game , but its kind of weird when i try to make a new world . i dont really like the world types : old , infinite , and flat . with old , the world is very small with one biome . with infinite the world is very glitch and it generates slow since there is no limit to its size . with flat really were just missing the customize option . now about the update . give us shields ! you gave us a shield slot but we still cant duel wield . and for some reason there are no fireworks . overall this is a great game but it needs work . ps : you should change the world options to classic , small , medium , and large like in the xbox one version
i love this game so but when you went to the boss update it completed just destroyed it . now it wont let me play on my acer <num> in <num> tablet please fix this !
ive been dealing with lag , now the whole thing freezes after opening my game . ive not been able to play this game for months , because of the constant issues . fix it .
i like that the interface is great smooth and clean online player is much better but mods skins and the fact that it has nothing to do with your pc account witch is horrible . my pc and windows accounts different so when i play a sever it doesnt know me so get pc it has mods and slightly better layout
its far far from the real thing but still has the basic concept . so i gave it a <num> for that reason . but its still fun to play now and then .
what obviously is the best thing about this is version is the performance . running on c++ or something of that sort , it much outperforms the java version . however , there are a few problems . first of all , the user interface is designed for smartphones or touch displays , however most pc minecrafters use mice . second of all , there is quite noticeable input lag , probably from vsync or something of that sort . and finally , player bumping . just no .
make your own house . play with your friends . you can do anything . have your mom getting mods for you . get cute skins . get gold . protect your self . food . pictures . i cant believe what you can do ! get or else . (not creepy u are) its fun join us the cool kids cause you are missing out
i really like it , but i think the pc version is definitely better , and i know many will agree . you cant download skins or log in with a mojang account . plus , there are no servers ! still an addicting game nonetheless .
i think its overall enjoyable .
i may not be the number one player or created anything super cool , but ive put over <num> hours into this game tinkering and playing around . i have this on pc , xbox <num> , and xbox one , and every time i play its just as fun . either by starting out a new game and exploring the beginning again , or your massive save file where you have your fortress . either way , its tons of fun !
i like the new fresh graphics thats it . its okay for beginners but really ? this is pocket edition guys ! dont buy it , if you have a mojang account go for it and get ready to be mind blown !
you are better off getting the pc version which include this edition for free . at first glance , this is no different than the version on my phone which was less than $ <num> . have not been able to associate this with a mojang account . the game that was downloaded and installed (and paid for) is unplayable except in demo mode . this has been much more of a headache than i would expect for close to $ <num> .
can you put a main menu at creative mode and we cant open chest and crafting table you update we can have main menu and open anything that you want in creative mod . hey and one more thing mojang , theis version of minecraft needs to be same as the original minecraft . and can you help me add the mocreatures mod to my minecraft cause is no fun having so less animals
does not have the same features as minecraft <num> . <num> . its as if its a pc version of minecraft pe . can be updated and added with the newest stuff .
the java edition is brilliant and there was no need to change it other than to lock it onto windows .
gracias israel por la cuenta
this is a fantastic game but what i want to know is why i dont also own the mobile version of the app multi platform is useless if i have to buy the same game twice . please fix and i will rate five stars
even on the lowest settings the mouse sensitivity is ridiculously high , to the point of the game being barely playable , that is if you dont mind getting sick in less than <num> seconds .
the interface is terrible for pc . the notyetported touch interface is so painful to use , it almost makes the game unplayable . worst offenders : nonremappable keyboard (not everyone uses wasd , esdf is far superior and ive died because buttons are in the wrong place) , hovertext often doesnt show up or flickers and vanishes too quickly , the inventory will randomly shuffle things around , redstone isnt implemented (which wouldnt bother me so much , but that also means that) you cant make pressure plates to close gates behind you , trading with npcs is broken . theres more . now , it certainly runs better than the java version , sometimes too well ! but without remappable keys its a sad imitation . keys are more important than mods , for me . and faaaaaaaaar more important than mp . what good are other players if i cant even control my character ?
i cant connect to the server i want to play on and i cant use my original username to play on it because its already taken . why do we have to connect to xbox live ?
i originally got this game because i thought i could join some servers with my friends , that was not the case due to the fact that minecraft windows <num> cannot connect to any of their servers ! i really enjoy the game , believe me i do but , its a big let down that i just paid almost <num> dollars on a game i cannot play with my friends . i would love to get a refund because this is ridiculous but i honestly dont think they give them and i cannot buy the java version due to having no money to do so . do not buy if you want to play with friends !
this game is great , ive always enjoyed minecrafts sandbox feel , and the games performance is great on lowend hardware (and this game is on par with <num> . <num> on full pc game) but it is missing one critical thing that will kill this game if not fixed . add in support for processors with x <num> architecture . why lock it down to only processors running with x <num> bit architecture ? out of the five pcs i own , i can only run the game on two simply because of a single processor limitation . please remove this mojang , otherwise , minecraft : windows <num> edition is doomed to fail .
the game is ok if youre a kid with a lot of free time . sadly , losing everything on death and without a way to easy transport the character to different positions in the world makes the game unlikely for a busy adult .
when i play my cursor keeps on pulling up the taskbar and the tab for the game and it keeps on , not only that but swaping out items just bugs out sometimes , i know this is still beta but come on its been out long enough
my cloud saves will not work . i have multiple computers and devices . so if i want to play minecraft but i cant because my worlds wont sync . so microsoft if you want to say this have cloud saves then make it have cloud saves im aj brewer and i , and i ! do not approve false advertising . ps its a pain in the but to transfer them over to other devices
<num> . <num> update brings in the much anticipated end dimension with all of the features from javas <num> . <num> end , however , it continues to lack features such as dual wielding and weapon nerf and buffs from <num> . <num>
this version is basically a version of minecraft with less features , and costs money to install texture packs . each texture pack costs a ridiculous amount , while you could just do some searching on planetminecraft and find a texture pack that is basically the same as the ones offered in these iaps , and download it for free . the add ons are basically like community maps with adventures , but there are so many good maps that already exist on planetminecraft and other sites that you can just download and install to the full version . there really arent that many redeeming features to this version , if at all .
first off , there are a few cool little things here and there . like the new boat mechanics and being able to create spawners and such . however , the ui is unbearably minimalistic and awkward to navigate . i would like to have more information and options than just a few sliders and some onoff buttons . now , as far as the controlresponsiveness . this is by far my biggest complaint , it feels like im playing on a console , not in a good way . although its supposed to be the windows <num> version of minecraft , this was clearly designed for a controller . even with a very high framerate , it still felt unresponsive at times . i will say that performance is great , until it crashes . <num> minutes in i had just found a village aaaaaand . crash . i am currently disappointed at this attempt . it looks like an xbox game it plays like an xbox game it may as well just be a new version for xbox . why windows <num> ? until they make it more crossplatform compatible , i really dont see the point .
the game doesnt include some featuresaspects of the vanilla pc release (such as modsfree texture packsdedicated servers) , but the switch from java to c++ makes the game run far , far better than any previous release to date . if you are willing to overlook some feature omissions , youll probably find this to be the most enjoyable way to play minecraft . also , includes full xbox <num> controller support !
the game runs pretty well , and switching controls works seamlessly , but basic options from the java version , like hud scaling , are missing
there seems to be some kind of fps problem even though my pc should be able to handle any game i throw at it . i can tell its not <num> .
its great , but it crashes after five minutes , i own it on my computer .
the biggest thing you need to keep in mind is minecraft for pc , the reason people even use it over the xbox or playstation is because of mods . basically we need some form of microsofts approval for modding and possibly an sdk for creating the mods (or something like an api)
the game is fun , i love the features , but microsoft store is bull i already had the game but it wont let me reinstall it on a different computer and it says i have to buy it again to get a new key since i already redeemed my key . it wont show up in my library even though ive played the full version on another computer . microsoft store and mojang service is terrible . i looked it up and you cant redownload it on any device . its basically a onetime install , so if something happened to your computer and it erased all files ? you have to waste another <num> dollars to buy a game that doesnt even allow mods .
this came preinstalled on my brand new computer . i played the demo and went ahead and purchased the full version since the option was right there . i was unaware that i was not purchasing the java version from mojang . i have attempted to get a refund to no avail . this is trickery and i would like to have the java version to play with my friends , but now i do not have the money to spare . tl ; dr microsoft tricked me into buying the terrible version of minecraft and seems to offer no way of getting a refund .
if you are sick of going outside and trying to build a castle but it just falls apart go get minecraft the full version it is so fun you get to show your creative side and you can play all day and join peoples worlds aka your friends worlds and you can kill stuff plus there is no blood well redstone kind of looks like blood but its not and for adults just let your kids show their creative side and a little secret for the adults , your children will listen more if you say do your hores thennnnn you will be able to play that game you like that people call minecraft and for me i did do my chores and guess what i gots to play well for us kids thats how we like it well kind of well i will only say a little bit more and for that little bit more it is that if parents dont want to deal with their kids just put em in front of minecraft and they will be blessed to see it and they will be glade they saw it well my good friend thank you for reading and taking the time to read my beautiful review .
if it seems to good to be true it most likely is . the windows <num> app development environment is meant to do for the desktopconvertiblehybrid pc market what mobile apps have done for apple & google : extort the loyal follower base for every mod , upgrade , and perk . dont get me wrong , there is nothing wrong with the base game and the gameplay is fast , crisp , and as addictive as ever not to mention just as developmentally appropriate for your kids : d just dont expect the mods and other cool hacks youve learned about over the premsft years to work in this version , because they almost certainly wont . not for a long time anyway . feedback for both mojang and msft : want higher ratings on this version ? support the modding community asap .
when i download java , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy windows <num> , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy pe , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy ps <num> , xbox <num> , xbox one and wii and switch it charges me $ <num> , <num> for each download . when i download <num> ds , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . mojang and microsoft , are you trying to steal my money or just be who are walking around being mean ? i do not recommend this stealer game !
i absolutely loved minecraft <num> . <num> . <num> on my mac but i cant play my mac so i got the new version of windows <num> and found out the game was out and tested it (i absolutely love being a beta tester) and it was pretty good apart from the fact the i cant make cauldrons or enchantment tables which could be a bug or they are still working on them . i loved it . <num> ign
i enjoy playing the pocket edition version of this game . and having the feeling of bringing it to the pc makes it feel more fluid . note this does need a good gpu otherwise you wont feel it .
the windows <num> version of minecraft was an amazing idea and its really fun . now , the bad part . i found a small bugissue when you climb vine , the sound you hear is like when you climb a ladder . other than that , there just needs to be more minor bug fixes and this will be an amazing addition to the versions of minecraft .
its addicting , i play it on the <num> , cant play it on my laptop due to graphics issues . but now i can thanks to this edition . i would love to see repeaters added to the list of the red stone . more like strongly suggest it . all do to the fact that i cant do some things that i can do on the <num> edition . love the fact that i am now officially able to play with my friend on the x <num> from my pc , its a great feature when i am not able to play on my x <num> .
after a painful purchasing process , i finally was able to get the windows <num> version . after a few minutes i found that this was a windows <num> pe edition . no clarity is made on the product name so its up to the user to guess and hope or somehow be aware of the many versions . refunds (if possible) are not easy to find on the web site .
though the graphics lack a lot the game is a great time killer and gave me a break from world of warcraft .
in app purchases are no good . for this reason and this reason alone i give it a <num> . nearly everything else is great or too soon in development to tell . things are different , but thats to be expected . i love that it is clean and fast . to the developers : <num> . ) i dont like the zfighting that occurs when a block is highlighted . the java version handled this perfectly using a wireframe highlight . <num> . ) particles disperse nicely except in confined spaces where they bunch up against the wall and fill the working screen real estate . perhaps consider making particles smaller and causing them to bounce off walls ? <num> . ) in app purchases . these hurt consumer confidence especially when making something based on a beloved game that was built entirely with consumerfirst thinking . dont do it ! <num> . ) so far so good ; i really like it . just dont fall into a moneyfirst mindset . im sure you remember how that worked out with the xbox one pr nightmare . i certainly do .
originally it was a pretty sluggish port . then the big <num> . <num> patch came and changed everything . if you have a windows <num> device at all , this is a must have . <num> would play again .
minecraft for windows <num> 终于回归，但是为什么我要登录xbox live 却登录不了呢！导致不能玩多人了！xbox live 不能使用的话，为什么不直接让我们登录minecraft的正版账号呢
hey pls make it free because there are <num> people are waiting to download but you need to give them space by making the game free for people pls we gave you million support now its time for you guys to give it us and i am not trying to get any kind ok take back . iam thinking ok people who are in the world suffering without the game because their parents wont give them money to buy . pls make it free then you guys will get more downloads
the mcpe windows <num> is not free so peppeal cant download miecraft : ( pls make it free thank you .
this game is amazing ! ive been playing for a few years ! and the possibilities are endless ! (like . the end . ill stop . ) but still ! you can do soooooooo much ! notch ! thank you ! wolfy
its a great game and all and i dont extremely dislike it , but i feel it is too closely related to pe . coming from the regular pc version , this is extremely different , and there are too many to name . second of all , i would prefer to have the ability to go on servers (i . e mineplex) . playing on singleplayer mode only gets very boring after a while .
green screen of death and the funny thing is it was working <num> months ago maby external video settings may work hint hint
so i decided to try out the new fullscreen option , where i was met with a frozen game and completely bugged out audio . you cant close the game even with task manager , and once it finally closes your audio will emit an annoying high pitch sound until you restart . once this is fixed i will fix my review .
could someone please tell me how to download this ? i click install but it keeps saying there is an error . i ended up getting it downloaded now , and it is awesome ! my fault !
everything works great , but its still a downgraded version of the full pc game
minecraft on pc has already grown tremendously and this seems like a huge set back towards all the progress . it is like pocket edition which isnt that good in my opinion with more blocks . also wish the controls were changeable because it is hard to reach ctrl if you are using a normal keyboard rather than a gaming keyboard .
i like minecraft , its my favorite game . but <num> . <num> is coming out soon and you are still on <num> . <num> or <num> . <num> . please your just adding commands , at minecon they are adding lamas and evil villagers . come on people , minecraft is a very popular game and i know you make a lot of money from it . i hope this does not offend you in any way .
well the fact that it allows json addons makes it a tiny bit better , but you can only do basic stuff in json such as change mob health and stuff like that . i wish you were allowed to make mods in c (or java or c++) . on top of that , mods in minecraft deskop edition (exe version) is what got me into code in the first place . i learned java and started making mods for mc in java .
the best game i have played on all platforms . i would say that the servers still need more work and the rest is just perfect . ops wrong game , this is not gta <num> (jk)
worst update to date , my paintings are gone , animals are despawning again , cannot open inventory without game crashing . my game isnt even playable unless i somehow find a way not to open my inventory and you kind of need that to equip armor ect . you are expecting people to start paying $ <num> . <num> when all your updates seem to include is more issues than the last . such a frustrating game .
why does game start at hold at mojang then close by itself with no errors . this is ridiculous that i have to waste a week trying to figure this out . if it was a apple product i would be able to find support within seconds but i have been shipped all around the world with no support . it cant be this complicated to fix a app issue . we have a windows <num> with up to date software . it was working and now it stopped , looks like others have similar issues with no resolution .
i like it . its basically a port of the mobile version of minecraft . except it only runs on x <num> cpus , which is annoying . my hp stream has a x <num> cpu but is running <num> bit windows due to the ram so i cannot install this game on it . update : now that it works on x <num> devices , it works flawlessly .
the game needs mods but perfect for ages <num> + the zombies , spiders and skeltons are fine but it needs a little work but for kids it is just fine but you need to remember .
i am a left handed person and when it came out i got my free copy . i thought that this would be a great way to play with my sister that only plays pe . when i opened it up i saw that it was at the moment a direct port of pe with some keybinds slapped on to it but after all it was just released . so i waited a few months and tried it again . with only one update and no progress it had not changed . the cross platform multiplayer still did not work and the only thing changed for the better was that i could now use the rmb to click on things in the menu and not only the lmb . i will look at it again in the future but at the moment i will stick to the pc version .
i like some of the animations , i also like how smooth it feels when you are walking or running . the only problem i have with it , well , <num> problems , is that the chat doesnt work , and the next one isnt really a problem , just a little annoying , but when you are flying , it doesnt move you to the side a little bit like the pc edition or other editions of minecraft . it kind of bothers me because i am used to it . but otherwise , it is great , also , is there new things in it , i noticed new boats , is that a new feature , or has it been there ? thanks ! ☺
java edition is what you want ! you cant even mod on this ! absolutely terrible !
every time i open this game , i check the settings , and immediately close it and head back to the real minecraft . this game would be worth playing for so many people , including myself , if you didnt keep trying to force the controller on us . its not hard to code button mapping . you already do it with controller , just do it with keyboard and mouse . minecraft is simply much better with keyboard and mouse , simple as that . ive been playing for a very long time , and i own every version of minecraft available . ive done the testing .
this game is a mix of the xbox version , (with the loading screen , inventory , ect) the mobile version , (the placement and movement) and barely feeling anything like that of the original pc version . i think its alright with the new additions with the weather and so on , but otherwise , it just doesnt feel right . ive had no problems with loading it , updates , or any other problems so far .
im on the free trial and iron golems spawn on a village and sooner or later kill me for no reason . i hide in my house but they manage to kill me through walls . weird bug
ive been playing minecraft for a long time and for a while i was kind of getting bored of it , but i just fell in love all over again . i dont know why but this is way better than the original minecraft , fun , addictive , and faster ! im defiantly buying this < <num>
every time i fire up the game theres is this dark grey window that pops in and out constantly causing the game to be unplayable . im unable to move even past the very first screen . bought this application to play with my kids , but im not even able to utilize it . edit : working on fixing the issue . ill keep you posted .
i didnt like anything youve done to this version . the design . the features . and the marketplace .
seems to be a port of the pocket edition , runs smooth but lack of game option is disappointing . better to spend your money on the actual version until support is improved , simply put the quality just is not what is should be .
its a survivalist version for sure . if you need mods , instant map cords , safe save points , and all that other little kid creative junk then go play the original . this is for the big boys . love the way everything is fixed as far as game mode and achievements . this way the real survivalists can say they did it with no modcheat help because the game disables all the achievements if you kiderizecreative mode it . once the realms are added . yes . we will separate the real gamers from the sandboxers .
minecraft windows <num> edition is worth buying but it is also not worth buying because why buy basic minecraft again . because that is what minecraft windows <num> edition is . if you want to be smart spend your money on the original minecraft . but if you would like to see where they go with this than buy it . think one way they could have improved minecraft windows <num> edition is by just taking the latest update of minecraft and started there . so in conclusion just by normal minecraft .
well this is only the beta . i wish i could change the keyboard settings to the arrows . i love the pc edition because u get to do more . this one is missing so many things . it has a lot of bugs . it needs a big update . before i buy those ? i want this to be talents rated <num> star all the way . i already have the pc version and i love it . the bad part is ? i cant use cheat codes . which sucks : ( because thats how i play the game . the one positive thing about this is . a bigger village ! : d i never seen one this big ever ! thats one of the things that i liked . but after all ? its only a beta . i like how the water is very clear in this version and how the color seems more hd . i love when game graphics are in high definition . especially minecraft . its needs a little bit more work . i hate how when u walk ? u hear the crunching of the grass . ___ that is really annoying . and i hate the cow noises . it sounds really weird . and i also hate the noises the character makes when they fall .
the control scheme is lousy . skins need to be bought . ive played the original pc version since it was in beta , and the controls work so much better . this is just the mobile version with a new title . not to mention the microtransactions . leave it to microsoft to ruin a great game . dont get me wrong , this is brilliant if you are playing on a phone , but , as a pc version , this is terribly tedious . the only reason i give it two stars is because it is very well optimized for a beta . little to no lag . if the controls were like pc with this level of optimization , <num> . if , on top of that , you take away any microtransactions , it would be <num> easy . as of now , it is just microsoft trying to make a quick buck . sorry mojang . you shouldnt have to suffer for them .
i always play pvp on windows <num> edition but i noticed something in the update <num> . <num> . <num> . i got used to the real hit detector and in the <num> . <num> . <num> update the hit detector is not good . its almost like im playing <num> . <num> pvp where i hit a player and i cant hit them for like <num> to <num> seconds and then i can hit them again . this process repeats and it is really annoying please fix this . thank you .
all i hear is static buzzing on my surface <num> . could be a problem with the app or windows <num> , or even the surface <num> . everything else works okay . would like to be able to modify more options and bring the cursor mode for tablet . and no fps lock would be awesome .
i learned from the customer comments (as it wasnt included in additional information) that the reason i cant download it is that my machine is running a <num> bit version of windows . this information should have been included in the press release . prepare for lots of kids whose parents promised them the new minecraft to be really bummed .
this is what i would expect from a port of a game issued on a very limited platform such as a smart phone or a last gen console . it stays true to the blocky graphics however does not take advantage of the higher resolutions a pc enjoys with even a basic built in gpu on the mobo . i can not see playing this version over the java pc version even if worlds are portable between xb <num> , pc , and phone . lots of work to do
i really am excited for the better together update and i want it now it has so man cool things i just saw a beta version and please release it early !
i love minecraft but . they couldve added more detail and animals like leaves swaying and have other animals like goats , snakes , maybe butterflies , crocodiles , or deer even .
it seems to have a bit of input lag , mainly with looking around . now this could be because of a fps lock or vsync . its pretty much pocket edition and doesnt have as much content as the regular java version . for touch devices this is a really good port , and thats probably the crowd its focused at .
awesome ! has all the new things . but i cant figure out how to tame a ocelot , fly , stop flying , stop a flood , and all that other complicated stuff .
im broke but love to death minecraft and ive always wanted a pc version so for the love of god please make it free for <num> day or <num> hour please !
my first instinct in downloadinghearing about this version of minecraft was : oh look , this windows app is going to be a huge improvement , much faster than the previous java ones , and will probably be very similar . i couldnt have been more disappointed . i cannot believe that microsoft has actually completely taken over minecraft , adding the abominable inapp purchases , the appalling gamertags , and making all users sign into their microsoft accounts . windows has gobbled up companies in order to promote their products . i honestly cant believe mojang developers would allow this . mojang isnt even a word in microsoft dictionaries . and heres another complaint , the gui and behavior of the game makes me feel like im a <num> year old , trying to play an amalgam of the pocket edition and the xbox edition on a pc . i do not play this on a tablet ! the ratings on this game obviously are fake , or there is some incentive for rating it high . word limit is reached , thus always to tyrants !
the only complaint is that it lags quite a bit .
i got this because i wanted to install mods for my pc but it turns out you cant and i want a refund
i stopped playing mionecraft but wanna refund my dlcs ecause i cant install them on my nbew pc
the game is getting constant updates with active server communities ! this is a really worth game getting .
f is for friends who play with you . u is for u are steve n is for
well , ive been using the original minecraft for years , and i have gone through the process of redeeming the code and it still attempts to charge me . i have talked to support , with no help at all . i wish mojang would try a little harder sometimes honestly .
thanks microsoft for x <num> support but it is extremely like pe and i dont want to play pe on a pc .
it cost almost as much as the java version but is way slower , harder to use , and you cant change the version to get a different style of pvp , many servers are not compatable with this .
i am using my surface to play minecraft , and it confuse my left click with my right click its really annoying . i would be nice to able to change it so it can be a key board command so will stop destroying things when i want to place a block .
its challenging and all but , the trial is only <num> minites come on thats not long enough
clearly you cannot fullscreen , or unlock your framerate . this will make some players experience input delay from mice , so i do feel that is a worthwhile change . but if you simply change the aspect ratio of your window to a skinnierwider rectangle your fov is effectively much wider .
it will not install on my nextbook flexx <num> . i have upgraded to windows <num> . what do i do i am crying right now . by this i mean it says i have to use a device with more features . what does that mean ?
the game plays fine , and it can be some fun even though it is based on the mobile minecraft . the only major issue i have with that is the lack of boss mobs . but the main problem is that no audio plays out of my speakers at all . to clarify , my <num> . <num> speaker system is silent while the game is running , but if i have audio play from my headphones , the audio plays normally . this inconvenience makes the game less enjoyable . also , why the heck does the game not freeze when you pause in single player ? its rather infuriating to pause in a cave and come back to find yourself dead .
lets be real here : java is a horrible language for anything serious . compared to more modern languages , its inefficient and too taxing on systems . one of its only redeeming factors is that its easier to use crossplatform , which is why theres only one version of pc minecraft on osx , windows , and nix . while w <num> edition isnt cross platform , it performs a helluva lot better because of the use of a different , more efficient language . worlds are created and load much faster , and i get much better performance out of this version compared to the old one . <num> . <num> simply because i can play without changing allocation of resources .
i made the mistake of purchasing this thinking it would be similar to the actual full original game . instead it ended up simply being a lackluster port of the mobile version . there needs to be more clarity that the actual pc version and this empty shell are two completely separate and different versions of each other .
its good , lots of potential using c++ or java . i really dont know . but paid skins ? thats the dumbest thing more dumb then a guy with <num> brain cell . sorry got mad and i should be . other then that pretty good so far !
i like in the java version of minecraft when it tells you the difficulty (peaceful , easy , normal , etc) this version just has a slider but doesnt tell you what level it is . also , i liked being able to hit f <num> and it would tell me what level , what biome , etc i was in , as far as i can tell , this version does not have that .
just a downgraded version of minecraft pc . there is already a mobile version (pe) and a pc version of the game . whats the point of this ?
its still a good game . a lot has changed since the beginning though . a bit of nostalgia .
there is no difference between the two . if you already have the tablet version , forget about this version and get the actual pc port ! if you dont have a credit card , buy a minecraft card at walmart an put it into the scratchoff back pin into the free downloaded driver (useless unless you create a account with the pin number) and you have the real version of minecraft ! the only setback is that its $ <num> more , yet worth way more . so , only get this tablettopc version as a last resort . youre better off getting the real version .
a : why was the information provided by f <num> removed ? id like to be able to see my coordinates sometimes . b : all the menus are crap . like seriously why do they look like the ones in the mobile version ! c : i assume this version was built on directx . give us more control over the graphics settings ! d : even with the graphics maxed out i can see popin when flying ! i thought we where on pcs so why such a limited draw distance for things like grass and flower blocks ? also why does the lod drop off so fast . e : i couldnt find a full screen button . can it go full screen ? if not , why ? f : why no commands ? how am i supposed to tp to other players in creative mode ?
was a great game , updated to the new windows <num> version and guess what , damn thing wont even start . reason i updated in the first place was because of the cross platform play for the kids , turns out it they charge you monthly for that and the use of the term cross platform is misleading at best . yet another ms fail .
youre better off downloading and installing the java version
bad . this game visual effects crash on a perfectly capable pc , and i can change all the video settings that i want , but the screen play freezes while the actual game play continues . i really really hope that an update is released to fix this problem , because it is a large inconvenience . the rest of the game is superb otherwise .
i have a mouse and keyboard , i want to be able to use it naturally with the controls i like , but they only have <num> qwerty layouts . its unplayable this way . do i have a controller , sure but its unplayable with a controller after having played it prems with a mouse and keyboard . controllers are good for some things , racing games , platformers , but not for first person adventureshooter . the controls are clumsy and imprecise . i will not play the ms version of this game till they fix at least the keyboard and mouse controls . i suspect there are quite a few other major annoyances that dont exist in the java client as well but i wont find them till they fix the biggest issue .
what i like about mc is the fact that you are aloud to go into creative mode and do anything . what i dont like about mc is the price for the real game . $ <num> ? my dad wont let me get it because it costs $ <num> ! another thing i dont like is that in the trial you arent aloud to go in creative . other than that , i am fine with this game forever . i also want you to update it really fast to be like the real pc version . plus this acts like pe on my computer because my computer is touch screen so , ya . if you update this game fast enough to reach <num> . <num> . <num> in a year , i will keep playing this once my computer is fixed . it wont let me download it to my computer because of avastfreeantivirus or this game is updating .
the ui is terrible , you cant right click to quick switch blocks out and there is no inventory in creative mode . no mod support , inapp purchases are just lame skins . you can get free skins elsewhere . its several versions behind the real pc version . limited max view distance which is basically the same as the xbl version .
in app purchases , forced tabletmobile user interface , and no sync with online mojang settings (skins) . overall , a very poor cash grab effort
dont get me wrong i love this game but it freezes most of the time and i dont know why also whenever it freezes for me it takes awhile to unfreeze and i have a new laptop and thats not my problem .
wont install on my pc
i like the fact you are making it for windows <num> , but whenever i try to play this version on my laptop i cant . it loads up fine , and i go into one of my worlds , but as soon as i left click all of my controls lock up . my mouse will not turn my view , and my keys do not move my character . i am not sure if i am the only one with this problem , but i cant even play the game unless i want to place one block at a time , then force close the game with task manager and do it again . sometimes the game will close randomly after i have clicked as well . can someone please help me out with these problems ? i have minecraft for pc , xbox <num> , ps <num> , and pe , but w <num> edition just does not work for me .
this game destroyed my life .
while this version shows some potential , this version of mc is pretty much just meant for single player . you cant add any pc servers that you play on , which pretty much defeats the purpose of playing minecraft . unless they do fix this in the future , id say stick with the original version of minecraft .
message to mojan . the game does not listen to the music . no music is not a game .
chơi bản free rất hay nên mình đã mua game này để chơi với bạn bè , không tiếc <num> . <num> vnd để mua , game quá hay
may as well play it on xbox if you want this style of minecraft . it doesnt support any pc friendly customization like mods or texture packs , the interface is clearly meant to be controller friendly which means awkward keyboard & mouse control , and being forced to make a new xbox gamertag is just ludicrous if you already have a mojang account . the performance is great , but that is to be expected with a very limited version of the game . if you cant afford a new xbox then i guess this game is great , but if you are a pc gamer just stick to the current minecraft client .
it reminds me too much of the mobile version , which seriously bothers me with the way its set up . i like the other minecraft version more , its menu system and stuff is set up better i think .
i hate it cant install it .
im brand new to minecraft . downloaded block story on my tablet and minecraft to win <num> pc . my daughter really enjoys creative mode in minecraft , but we both play survival in block story . few primary reasons : <num> . minecraft does not have any tutorial (quests in block story) . when youre completely new to the game , its hard to figure out whats going on and what youre supposed to be doing without any tutorial . i find it very poor . quests in bs really help you understand the game and send you off on a great adventure . <num> . recipe book is completely missing in minecraft . i find it very handy in block story to explore new tools , weapons , armor options etc to conquer the next level . im completely lost without a recipe book in minecraft . <num> . game controls . especially on the crafting table . for example , separating items from a stack can be a challenge . had no issues in block story , but still am straggling in minecraft . again , tutorial would be very handy . please , think about newbies !
items that are missing : maps , pressure plates , horses , ender pearls , eyes of ender . i will update this list as i find more . also , i cant trade with villagers . when i am playing it is forcing me to be connected to wifi , even though i am only playing by myself . i dont want to be online . its stupid that i cant just play the game without wifi . when i am connected to wifi , the game constantly freezes and is impossible to play for more than a few minutes . the game keeps shutting itself off when im playing . every time it does this the game glitches and my flatland becomes a tiny strip of flatland surrounded by walls of water , lava , caves , and stones . flying to the top always reveals a infinite world , and it means i cant keep that world and the project i was working on . i have to start over .
microsoft killed the game . s updates , no mods and changed some mechanic . the game is dying
like my title , its the same version as the java version but worse and restricted with microtransactions . why would i pay for something that was free before ? make this stuff free microsoft , youre wasting time with making money instead of improving the games experience .
dose , t give commands when i type something in its says error ; command not found i put first to add cheat please please !
i am a previous owner of the pc version of minecraft . i got the free download code , and i redeemed it . everything was fine at first , but apparently , i cant download my game . i redeemed the code back in august of last year , and i havent been able to play the game . i have tried everything to get the game up and running , but the store still has the purchase and free trial options . i think i would actually ike the game , if i could get the download up and running (like it should have during august of last year . ) ive checked every forum and q & a page for a solution , yet ive found none (minecraft windows <num> doesnt even show up in my recent downloadspurchases pages) . ive spent over <num> hours total trying to find a solution . what a waste of time .
i have yet to be able to play the game . it says it is already installed but i am <num> sure it is not installed . update : finally installed and i opened it . freezes upon opening .
it reminds me of the pocket edition , but this needs windows <num> edition exclusive content
i liked original minecraft , meaning before the windows <num> version . here are a few reasons why : <num> . directx <num> and not java this is very important for people who dont have expensive gaming rigs . on original minecraft there were enough options for graphics that made the game a smoother and more enjoyable experience through the power of java . directx <num> isnt made for streamline pcs . meaning if all you have is your moms work laptop to read this , your out of luck . <num> . too much like mobile this game looks like it was made for tablets , from the u . i , to the controls , and to the graphics . this is just microsofts way of saying well heres another uncompleted version of a game youve been waiting for , for the past <num> years , and <num> . you have to pay for the beta really ? $ <num> for a beta ? i mean its not that bad but if your new to minecraft this isnt the way to start . it will most likely be another $ <num> for the full game anyways ! so unless you already own minecraft on pc , dont get it !
initially i had download store error but it seems like they fixed it . plays great hard to play on controller . hit box on animals seem a little off . please bare in mind that windows <num> platform includes surface , desktop and windows <num> phones . minecraft windows <num> edition is made with surfaces in mind(minecraft pe) overall great job .
i don like that the update dosent have new animals like goats , horses better horses @ least evey thing eles is cinda good but you could use more villages in this world that are easy to find and here are some more villages here are some more animals that you could possibly add to the next update goats , turtles whales live fish , whales so basicly see creatures and cheates diraffes , hipoes , and safarie animals , more wiled animals
i was sort of disappointed , in the pictures it showed that it looked sort of fun . villagers , creations , creepers , etc . but in the game its just sort of sad . that need to add much more things such as redstone , the end , a design other than the mcpe edition , and something that really bothered me customized controls . on regular minecraft the controls i used were much different , so when i got on and i left clicked , it deleted a block , i used it to place a block , it bothered me very much . i know this is in beta testing and it will get better but for now it just needs a lot of fixingadding
the game needs mods . i think this game would be much better if we could us mods . thanks notch
start window comes up and music starts playing with the blurred background gently spinning around like it is supposed to , but another window keeps flashing on and off on top of the main window and i dont get the opportunity to sign in or anything . it is quite disappointing . hopefully you will fix what is broken or have a suggestion for me so i can move the star . uninstalled and reinstalled . still sucks . added java to my machine in case it made a difference (thought there might be a little java dependency left in the code) but still sucks . i cant fault microsoft for screwing things up , after all , it is what they often do . (note : sometimes ms does great stuff , but all too often they really mess up [pg version of my thoughts]) but why wreck a perfectly great game ? here is the microsoft business formula : buy something that rocks . wreck it . charge more for it , and expect your customers and the original fans to love you for it ? ha ! you must think you are donald trump !
the game is stupid because : <num> st microsoft made it and they wont just money money money . you need to buy skins ! lol <num> nd mincrosoft is gonna have theyre own servers that means no one is gonna play the servers hosted by players that means no fun . that is sad because i love to be a owner of a server but now in this game there are gonna be no players and microsoft if you are reading this please dont think always about money you have <num> bilions and please dont destroy the game with that thing let the players host thair own servers = more fun if you will have your own servers no one is gonna play server from the players . if you would fix that the game is gonna be awesome please lett the players have the servers and microsoft the game : )
it is the literal copy of pocket edition with maybe a couple added features but is nothing new and is a waste of time stick to regular mc kids
it wont load like when i open minecraft it crashes at the loading screen were it says minecraft plz help me because i love this game
i got this game by a code when i got the java version now i cant download the full game anymore . i am using the same email i used to use the code as well . i just bought minecraft again doesnt matter anymore
this game is so much fun i have a blast playing it love the look and all the different however ! the crashing it crashes a lot is there solution if not can you get an update that fixes it quick sometimes it crashes right after starting other times just randomly itll crash and i have to reopen than that its the only problem other than that love the game fix the crashing itll be a five !
i redeemed the code on my pc to use on my kids pc and it would not allow me to do so , so now they cant even play it .
great update but each time i try to pause it , it freezes and i cant do anything so i have to force close it but other than that its amazing that it is now an official store game instead of pc online download it runs faster and much smoother please fix the bugs thanks : d
every time i try to download it says error <num> x <num> f <num>
sometimes the game crashes and sometimes when you click you cant move or you keep moving in one direction and cant look around . also , sometimes you have to keep clicking repeatedly to break a block . other than that the game is great !
this game is so addicted , great time killer , and the main thing is why this game need to buy when the youtuber or other website know how to download with no permission and no need to buy if this game no need to buy and install im sure a lot of people gonna like this and if you want a money you can make in by buying in the pack , skin and texture right !
it runs fine on my machine but you loose that amazing feature of moving your worlds that you spend a lot of time building on from older versions . purchased for one machine to test , not likely to buy it for my kids . they dont want it on their machines because of that .
microsoft installed without my permission
i cant even get the up date
i need those sweet sweet achievement points to fill the void left in me by my lack of social life . all i need to feel accepted is a little more gamerscore . but alas , the game fails to start , crashing after the mahjong logo , and preventing me from getting the euphoric dosage of minecraft achievements .
so as i was looking at the main menu i see add server so i looked around set up my own server and just like i thought it is doing nothing when i click add server . also this is lagging on a i <num> <num> th gen intel cpu with <num> gb of ram and <num> gb ddr <num> gpu <num> . <num> mind you it is the only thing that was running and not in multi player . this is going to need a lot of work before it hits the full version . the only reason i got this was the fact i get it for free because i have the pc version of mc . otherwise do not waste any cash on this app yet ! i feel the project was rushed and is a bad name for mine craft all together .
its great but it needs better controller support(like exactly straight from the xbone <num> version) , it feels awkward compared to the consoles in creative mode . it also needs the crafting guide from the console version too , im not trying to get a online guide or memorize combinations for crafting . it definitely needs big updates for this game , maybe ill change up the score after it feels more like the console version with the big benefits of the pc version but for now , it feels like i cant enjoy this game like i do on the xbone .
wont let me update to <num> . <num> , so i tried uninstalling and reinstalling , but when i click install it just says sorry , something happened at our end
i like the game it is so much fun ! but sometimes it can get a little stressing and confusing and i dont know what to do ! but over all i mostly enjoy it like i said before ! : )
make minecraft cheaper because what if people dont have that type of money you guys are messed up !
i like a lot minecraft and i can play this everyday and is more cool then mcpe
after i selected full screen mode the game just stopped working . ive tried leaving and coming back into it but it just freezes right away . plz fix
so now . it only freezes when i have wifi on but when airplane mode is on its fine , is this fixable ?
i have been waiting ages for certain features to be included and they still are not
i hate it ! it keeps asking me to connect to xbox live and i dont want to i just want to play like my computer . i hate it eve after purchasing everything its locked for xbox wtfffff
unless you want to waste <num> bucks on this piece of garbage game , i wouldn’t buy it . this is the most pointless game , why get this when you can get the the better version where you can actually get mods . the only reason this version is a thing is because the money loving jerks at microsoft want to rob you of your money . dont buy it .
dude the update is soooo good i recomend buying right now !
stop fixing all the farms we create dang it . it supper annoying to see hundreds of hours and players farms stop working so not cool . missing the note block still plz add it
app doesnt even open ran fine with a few expected glitches of a beta for awhile now the game doesnt even open up . even having trouble finding a uninstall option to reinstall it .
i like it but how to turn to creative
when i try to play with others in a lan party . for some reason it doesnt allow for us to share a world without having internet . i will be able to see there host world and try to connect to it , but when i do it sits there saying something like looking for server and then it times out saying it cant connect to it . i am pretty sure that the host is the server , so this shouldnt be an issue . although when i am connected to a network with internet it works fine . i can see their host world and join with no problem . currently we are doing this between the android and the windows <num> version . if you could fix this i would give it a straight up <num> stars .
i like it because its very addictive game and have a good graphics but i want it to be free because i already purchase the android edition
ive attempted to return countless times , for the past few weeks , to play this game . i was able to run this game for a short amount of time when i originally upgraded to windows <num> , it has since been updated to <num> . <num> . <num> . after the update , i went into the settings and selected full screen mode and the game froze . since then , every time i load the game i get an immediate freeze upon seeing the title screen . it allows me hear music and select either options or play while clicking other menus does nothing . when i enter either of the two accessible menus , the background spins normally , music play , and thats all . clicking or highlighting anything further will cause the game to freeze while the music still plays . i would love to play this game and buy a second copy to play alongside my so but this is strongly halting me from doing so . tl : dr dont select full screen and avoid picking this up unless you are willing to beta test a broken game or its free .
everytime i try to download it says error like wtf
i love this game so much its fun to play and everything but u need to upgrade it more we need more animals and u should have a server that everone can play on like a freee sever pls try to upgrade and make it a little bit more better thx x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num>
i just paid $ <num> for a game i cant even play , seriously ? i finally finished installing the game and i click open the app and it starts to open and then crashes . is this just a scam to get money with no product ? im furious . i should get a refund or a functional game .
good , but java is better
the cost is high but manage able but i dont understand why i unable to transfer to this computer from another because the other broke
i think for the xbox , windows <num> , ps <num> , pocket , and all the other editions except pc , because you already did add one in pc , add a sprint button ! and this game to me just doesnt feel like home to me like <num> . <num> pc . also please make the control settings better . and just for sake i dont like your idea on making mc more realistic and i hate pc <num> . <num> and <num> . <num> pvp . thanks . oh but i love realms
this reminds me of dayz , the original armaii mod . it was amazing , and then a copy was made which was similar , but lacked the polish and authenticity . the newer version sucked , badly too . when i launched the game , i instantly felt like i was taking part of some poorly developed scheme . microsoft please , just because you have new ownership doesnt mean you need to prove to everyone that you can make what a few developers originally made . instead of making a beta minecraft , you should get a team and convert minecrafts java to c++ .
do not get ! from the reviews i could figure out it is basically pe version but on a computer . it also costs a lot more .
when dose the <num> . <num> update come out
i logged in to mojang , and it gave me the redeem option . when i clicked on redeem , it told me to login with your microsoft account , which i did , and then it said that it was redeemed , but i never had the option of downloading it for free . the game itself is almost similar to the actual game . there are huge performance boosts , and it kinda reminds me a bit too much of the windows phone version .
its obvious that microsoft plans to microtransaction the game . drop it now , and keep to the java version .
there is never an update button there need to be one ro i can never play this again with out fun . we neeeeeeed the update button . like really neeed the update button . oh never mind i found it thank you for the game < <num> < <num> < <num> .
xbox one controller support is finally here ! wish i didnt have to have a gold account to play locally on lan .
reminds me of pocket edition has potential but one star from me for now
i like the game but it really needs the built in crafting guide while you craft instead of making you know all the steps yourself .
this should be for ffrreeee
okay , i still get it is a beta game . but instead of building mechanics off of the xbox ; do it off the pc . or keep it and have the option to boot normal pc . because i get it has to have the same functionality . i do like the convenience of it in live tiles but , i normally play pc and this felt like the dark ages of it . so it would be great if at release , there is a normal version for my mods and normal and pc play . you can only integrate two platforms so much .
cant pause the game . it keeps running , even when im in the esc menu . cant change the resolution . cant use my old save files . everything feels clunky with the keyboard and mouse . it kind of feels like they just ported over the xbox version , where youre supposed to use the controller . it works , but it feels very disconnected from my inputs . theres this weird thing with my view . maybe its a result of the poor (and unchangeable) resolution . the view is either too close , or i get this weird , shimmery , fisheye effect where everything i can focus on is both too sharp and too far away , and everything else is in perpetual motion blur , even if im not moving . it makes me nauseous , and theres no happy medium between the two . all in all , absolutely hate this version .
hyellow ! hit is yer boi , dr . russia commming at u live frum ze mudder russia isself . todaey we are gunto be dropp sum sicc nastie beets on gaem . is lot better than carpy gaem , undertail and i hate all other gaems . russia is best , we hav gud nastie beet , if u dunt leik minces raft then u succ and u shud die . gg no re . dunt u daer give bad review . get off my board ! reeeeeeeeeeee !
this game adds more features like auto jump its great for people who get tired easy by pressing the space button and third person as an option from the menu plus the sound affects sound great like the spider for example it sound more like a spider in real life so i look forward to this games official release .
i like how its challenging , but the trail , only <num> minutes . i dont like that .
its not worth a purchase , im not even sure if its worth the space on my hard drive ! i began playing minecraft in <num> and have loved the game . i have played the pc , xbox , and pocket edition versions and by far the best is pc it is the most developed , has the best community and the best interface ! first thing i noticed when opening up this game is an xbox live account is forced upon me . the next thing i noticed and probably the biggest downfall is the interface , they took the worst interface of the <num> and used it its awful . the pc community is one of the best communities i have ever seen and a large portion of that is due to mods and servers . and minecraft windows <num> edition does not support mods or servers yet ! the flying is god awful and it still fills your hot bar with items in creative a feature they removed ages ago on pc . dont buy this you will regret it .
glad to know that microsoft intentionally made it difficult for newcomers to the minecraft series to differentiate between the windows <num> edition , which is essentially the mobile version , and the real game . i bought this assuming itd be the actual game , just very optimized for windows . im very dissatisfied with my purchase and am definitely going to take considerations the next time i deal with microsoft . awful business model .
keeps freezing up . after several , as few as <num> , actions it freezes up and you sit there waiting for it to free up again . really frustrating . i have died lots of time cause when it frees up sometimes it takes off running off cliffs , into lava , etc . dead you are . i know i did not pay much for the game but i think it should work better than it is . come on guys lets get this working better .
when is cross platform with xbox one going to release ?
playing this is the same as on the ipad , but mine is messed up so using this really helps me a lot . for you people who want an update , it should come out any day now . although , since you log in with xbox accounts , it would be better if it was more similar to the xboxps <num> version .
this game , should not be out yet . its very broken and online play is awful . not nearly as many options , you have no way of knowing your location without using cheats , so in multiplayer if you get lost no finding your way back and might as well create a new game . it will drop you randomly , and cannot be trusted to save games accurately . i will still play the java version until this game is not broken . great idea , but ideas work if the game works .
i really like it , they have improved since the last version . keep the updates coming mojangmicrosoft .
i own a laptop , so playing this off of that makes it easier . but i own minecraft on the ipad , and i didnt want to spend $ <num> on a game i own already , and dont really like . so after playing <num> o minutes of the free version , i guess ill write my review . keep in mind that the free version is pretty limited . anyways , i dont see any thing different . sure , i may not have seen a few things before , but i mean , come on . its the same thing you can get off of the ipad , just with better controls . i have no idea what multiplayer is like , remember this is the free version . crafting is a bit of a pain , and even more so when you dont get any tips . heres what the free version has ; no creative , no tips on how to do things , no multiplayer . i dont see any need to buy this , unless you love minecraft . hope this was helpful . ~peace all .
between very little mod support , a lack of supporting saves and worlds , and so little information on what i actually got being presented truthfully , honestly the worst thing i have ever spent money on . i hope microsoft realizes theyve dropped the ball with this mess of a release , but considering its essentially the same game being sold again , and its microsoft , i feel as if theyll continue to milk minecraft as an ip as much as they possibly can for as much money as they possibly can .
updating my review to <num> star , now that its working on lowerend tablets as well . my kids and i are very happy so fun to play with each other across our phones and tablets !
game will not play . there is just a blank green screen while music plays in background . have done updates and troubleshooting but still not success .
deberian dejarnos conectar minecraft con playstation
wish it worked with <num> bit but having no issues on my <num> bit machines .
i open up the game its in the task bar its the mojang logo for a few seconds then it shuts down and isnt in the task bar anymore i also uninstalled it and reinstalled it but its still not working any more i have a question for you bill gates why is this not working like god damn i have a windows ten computer and all the reqirements so please fix this damn bug in the system
i cannot play , every time i try moving and doing things in game i manage to start programs from my quick bar .
it isnt any different from the current minecraft , graphically . features ? well , if you play minecraft religiously on pc then i would stay away . coming from a mobileconsole platform ? then i would suggest playing it . but i played it once , for five minutes and could not get my mind off : why would microsoft pour money into this ? because it is absolutely pointless . they spent money on making a port of a console game that was already on pc for pc . good job , microsoft . you never cease to amaze me . (windows <num> is good though)
i love the game and i play it but i think its way overpriced for an app . i wish it was either free or $ <num> . <num> because that seems fair .
its coded in c++ , right ? if so , then its poorly optimized . all minecraft versions have been like that so far . its lacking quite a few details that should be easy to port to c++ . other than that , it is minecraft , and the interface is simple , and it does run a little better than the previous version . looks like a college student project to say the least .
that is all this is a strip and rebuild of the original game crafted by microsoft so that mods bring in nothing but revenue for microsoft . i play the original version way more than this one . in fact the only time i play this version is when my kids are playing it and i have too . microsoft should have just built on the original model and went from there . they have not even attempted too improve the graphics or the user interface to make it easier to create mods . microsoft+minecraft=destruction of the series .
come on microsoft , minecraft is a great game and you turned it to crap with the windows <num> edition , its just a really crappy version of pocket edition but useable on computers , you cant even log in as yourself , and dont give me the beta crap like seriously theres already a fully released version , use it as a template instead of creating it from scratch , grow a brain and stop screwing up an amazing game
movement controls are terrible . feels like moving with the dpad . aiming is terrible . not fluid . rendering on xbox one x is still garbage despite the enhancements . hdr makes game way too dim with no option to control brightness or contrast . controls are clunky and feel like an obvious keyboard game transitioned to a controller with far less buttons . was very hyped . but after a few games im very disappointed .
by the time that this game reaches a state that is any where close to being worth its cost , something much better will be out for battle royal fans to play . pubg is dying fast . they ruined their chance to be something great . by the end of the year this game will be done for . garbage uninstalled <emoji> money wasted <emoji> good bye <emoji> ✌
cant play one game in mexico without crashing latest update now made russia crash daily . no reason for a game to be out for this long still have this many issues . no real reason to play this game , since you cant play this game . i feel like ive been robbed of my money .
if my grandpa gave me <num> <emoji> then i would buy this game <num> times ! ✌✌ <emoji> legit the best shooter to ever come to the xbone juan x holy gauceeemole this game probably has the best graphics like ever created <emoji> they must have teleported to the furture and created the best game engine to ever be ran <emoji> my favorite clothing item in the game would have to be big shaqs mans not hot <emoji> jacket . ok so back on topic . my daddy loves me lots like more than your dad could ever love you because unlike your dad my dad eats <emoji> i think that if your dad loves you he would by pubg (and thats is pronounced poob <emoji> gee) oh and btw if you havent played fortnite yet dont get mad get glad because like that game is hot <emoji> garbage <emoji> this game has it all pvp⚔⚔⚔ cool cars <emoji> hot girls to flex on <emoji> and has the biggest open world you have ever seeeeeeen <emoji> well i think i might have to go soon because i only get <num> charaters and im already on <num> so goodbye
fortnite has nothing to this game !
it finally comes down to me and a few others left . i have great loot and in a good position to get to the next circle . i start up my dune buggy and make my way through the woods until suddenly , my screen turns black and sends me back to the xbox home screen . i attempt to join back in the match and find myself dead due to my exposed vehicle . the amount of times i have had my game crash is absurd . video games are for me to be entertained not stressed out . i have also experienced a bug to where i can not scroll through my inventory and causes me to not aquire most of the loot i need in order to survive . another thing that would make the game easier to play would be the amount of time it takes for buildings and other objects to load in . it sometimes traps me in walls eventually killing me . the game needs more effort from all game producers because future games will run this game over with a truck . thanks for your attention .
nothing beats sitting there in a loading screen .
this game will be great once the bugs are fixed , but it is not worth the money yet due to constant crashes and texture issues . wait for full release .
for being such a simple , small sized game not to mention two updates in . it is still not very good . ( playing on xb <num> x & google fiber isp) i get booted from at least <num> out of every <num> games and most of the time its more thsn once per game . clunky aiming for a non aim assist game . frames per second still drop significantly . grenade physics . overall it feels like im playing a ps <num> game .
from the lobby to the action on the ground there is constant lag and framerate droppage . its fun but im playing on an xbox one x , there shouldnt be a problem like this .
there is nothing else quite like it except fortnite but not everyone likes cartoons . further more it is extremely confusing to learn but also very fun when it works . <num> worth the <num> bucks . my one and only complaint asside from the early acess bugs is no first person only servers !
the game is trash . it still has a ton of crash issues even after server updates that were supposed to fix the issues . audio needs tuning as well . sounds will emitt from the wrong audio speaker causing confusion . a lot of intermittent lag , rubberbanding , map and weapons not rendering . save your money until their updates do what they claim .
people need to chill about the lag and crashin it is still in game preview and is not fully released . btw this is the best <num> player pvp ive ever played and this game is <num> x better than fortnite !
worried about fortnite more than their own game . i try to come back and give it a second chance from the mushy buildings and poor performance but i literally cant get in the game . press a to reconnect but nothing happens . i looked into solutions but there was nothing . i uninstalled and reinstalled and it didnt work . this is borderline robbery because i cant play the game i payed for . want a suggestion ? play fortnite because they address their games issues to the public and they dont whine when someone takes their idea and makes it better .
you will need a phd to navagte the controls . fix this then it will be fun
the game at its current state isjust bad
great game and to those that gave it <num> star for graphics and fps or u suk but its in game preview meaning its gonna have problems do research before u complain about it idiots
nothing to like about it . frame rate should be <num> fps but its only <num> fps but gameplay is literally maybe <num> fps . game gets even worse fps and lag when shooting someone . going back to fortnite much much better than this . i will be refunding this game asafp
this game . piece of , cant hear anyone around you . also cant fix the
the crashing and lag are very bad , every time . you pay <num> dollars and the game isnt even worth free this is very poor ! p . s . in squad it has taken my brothers and i <num> min . and <num> sec . no button for <num> people to play instead of <num> crazy wait to get a game even going just to lag out this is nuts , if it doesnt get better soon i will have to contact the bbb feel ripped off here . this game is also on pc crazy how you can put out a game so bad with the lag and kicking out of the game and call it good , crazy to do this to anyone . have to say the <num> squad much better addition is great , since the last up date , but still the lagging out of games is the worst part of this game poor !
guns are better than fortnite logic , but this game always crash and your up straight in the butthole faggot enjoy <num> th place
if you loved high class desserts this game is that . the problem is now imagine youre only allowed to lick it and sometimes its made wrong . do not buy right now until its fixed . high frame drop , lots of lag , and its rare when u play a match without crashing
awesome solo duo or squad based game , some minor kinks but the fun outways them all . definitely worth the <num> gb space on your harddrive . forget fortnite and get your real chicken dinner <emoji> <emoji>
whats the name of that song that goes bee boo boo bop , boo boo beep ?
its pubg time ! rawr xd
i tried to customize my avatar and just pressing a button locks in everything and boots you to the main menu ! trying to recustomize your avatars appearance costs <num> bp . this is screaming out ripoff also the shooting mechanics are severly fd up and i mean a whole lot
pubg is the single , greatest game in the world . from the smooth controls and above average graphics , this game is a great buy for any hardcore gamer . sure theres a few bugs , but hey , thats expected in any game . even its top competitor , fortnite , has bugs , so cut it some slack . all in all , buy this game , and drop in solo , or i recommend with your friends .
game is sooooo laggy doesnt even load right . by far the most trash game of <num>
best game i have ever played never lags game play great also im on the original xbox one .
it is the most garbage game i have ever played in my life .
pubg is a beast of a survival game
i bought the game an it dont even work . biggest waste of money
im starting to shoot threw players making the game unplayable this is never gonna get fixed very disappointed pubg had the most potential but now its just dying (update) its getting worse i cant believe i spent money on a broken game (update) frame rate makes the game unplayable and frags dont kill any chance i could return this waisted space ?
if you want smooth gameplay , look elsewhere . textures do not load after dropping off , keyboard and mouse users ruin precisionbased gameplay , heavily rng based early on (you get a gun or you dont) . and the devs have absolutely no intention of fixing any of this . if fortnite ever adds a game type that doesnt allow building then i will happily substitute it due to the fact that it is significantly more optimised . if you plan on getting pubg , get it on pc . the xbox version is grossly unfinished to the point where it should be near criminal to charge money to gain access to this nonsense . and if all of this wasnt enough , the devs believe this heaping trash heap to be esports ready . <emoji> edit : other br games that dont include building are about to make this game an untextured disgusting piece of shameful history . good riddance .
the fact tht u get disconnected constantly
game is trash . keeps lagging and when it get to <num> people it crashes
dont buy this garbage can its not ready yet crashes like <num> times in <num> game <emoji> zebi wsayi
it be better without the game crashing as soon as i land plus other crucial moments rubberbanding every where !
really fun and alot of potential . alot of fixes to come ahead . but people forget game is still in alpha and not a finished product
i think it sad you guys said it a free preview but we had to pay <num> $ that most of us waisted money we cant get back well played with the sega genesis graphics lagg is horrific worst preview ever stick with pc please it better to watch other play on twitch thank merry christmas happy new year
so much fun , solo or with friend , <emoji>
every time i get into any game it freezes . reinstalled twice and tried atleast <num> games .
buyer beware dont buy this garbage . never ending money pit . <num> dollar event pass , microtransactions before stready frames an gameplay . thats what we all get after all this time and all our money . hiya guis thanks for you support these last months since preview we got somthing special for you in return for leaving yall hangin with a halfass game . you just got to spend some more money first . pubg devs . dont buy this garbage
this game is great for the most part . there are some bugs that can be annoying , and occasionally crashes , but it is a great game .
a <num> game too add to you collection !
best game in along time
game crashes more than stevie wonder trying to drive
its like playing a mobile game on console . not worth <num> $ . buggy as hell and not streamline at all . wasted my money .
the game itself is solid for a game made by modders but the crashing can happen multiple times in a single game , it doesent help that the cars act randomly and lag makes the game unplayable . i would not recommend buying this game until many many patches into the future . if you really want a battle royal game just get fortnite , its not as good but not broken .
but , there should be a map preference option . the newer maps are more open and made more for sniping . not everyone is good at itprefers it . puts people at a disadvatage . also for those who want better performance get a pc . xbox one x is just a slightly better s .
the devs fixed the crashing issue and have done a lot of updates . def worth it .
like most people i have played pubg on pc for a long time . i was excited to share this experience with my xbox live friends . after playing it on the xbox i am truly disappointed . it runs like garbage . i understand it is still in the developmental stage but come on . the initial stages on pc were worlds better .
kinda smooth gameplay but inventory management is the worst thing ive ever seen . get over the hype . save your money and play fortnite .
this game is great ! one must remember this is a game in preview so dont expect it to be perfect aand it isnt fornite or call of duty either ! this is battle royale ! so go scavenge and have fun ! ps . please dont give it a bad review because you suck . ijs !
needs work but shows potential .
i cart beleeve the makor of this gaym hav te bawls <num> copi forknight completely unnoriginnul <emoji>
for all the people who say this games frames are trash idk what year your in but it runs fine on a s so stop . gunplay is more fair then fa i mean fortnite . graphics are fine we dont need <num> fps all the time . map is better more varity . luck is half the game so thats why its fun not every bloody game you have a chance of winning . goodbye fas
the terrible framerate and screen blackouts make this game hard to enjoy . i recomend fortnite over this because it is free and more fun .
i love this game <emoji> for all the people complaing its a game preview for a reason . its an unfinished game so of course its not going to be perfect . if you dont like it then dont play its that simple . i cant stand people that expect perfection with a game preview . grow up !
i like cold beverage yeah
okay , so for around most of the year ive been wanting to play this game . but i cant due to the fact that the screen doesnt load in before the actual game ? so im having to hope when i land that im not near anyone as i have to prone to wait for the screen to load . yes you heard right . i have to wait for the game to load its own screen . how about a ? oh , i dont know , a loading screen ! or just dont put me in the damn game
super fun and addicting all the <num> star reviews are frigging cry babies . games unfinished they most likely suck and expect instant gratification or a participation trophy like most whine millennials . its <num> everyones a critic and offended by anything and everything lets see you whiners make a better game . you wont smdh .
here ya go ! before my rant , i really love this game ! i hear on mixer all the time it is a workinprogress sort of game(preview) . its been out <num> months . so , between the rubber banding , xbox locking up , pixelating , and the endless time wasted getting back in a game to find out you have been snuffed out . so much needs to be done . it is online play only(no campaign) you do have option to single , duo , or squad play . it does have a big map and what i hear , after fully complete there will be <num> . so , lots of learning . oh , this preview does not come with a manual . more fun to learn that way . all in all , hopefully this game gets fixed in the near decade before pubg <num> comes out . until then , have fun gamers !
i won a game and wasnt awarded the <num> bp it said i earned . until this inequality is justified , this game will retain a <num> star rating . compensation must be awarded . update : i just won yet another game and was still not awarded the bp i earned . you now owe me <num> bp player unknown .
it feels like a rushed to be finished product , drifty aiming , lagfest .
what has made me mad is the crashes they mess me over so many times and frame rate i thought it was going to be frames from the computer but instead we get this garbage
laggy as not worth the buy
overall great game and good price , although it could use a little work on the map lag but it isnt that bad considering it just released
the game is soo terrible . draw distance is garbage . frame drop to no end .
plays horrible on console ! slow , ugly and clunky . plus tthey give no return option ! waste of $ <num> . do yourself a favor and get fortnite instead . its free and looks <num> x better than this . buyer beware !
in an attempt to stop fortnite from conquering the console they threw this garbage into the ring to fight and its getting destroyed . this console port is horrid and a shameful example of corporate greed .
i have lots of time in on this game . from the start of pc and xbox . they fix the game and then patch it broken in <num> days . they dislike your input so dont waste your time . buy the game , its worth $ <num> . dont get your hopes up . <num> years in now and they are still letting us down .
still a piece of get fortnite instead its free and better than this will ever be
this game is utter . you land into a world of solid cubes until about the first <num> seconds then blobs of houses begin to show with no interior . fighting is decent but still terrible for how many peeple play this game bluehole is completely taking advantage of us as gamers $ <num> for somthing that looks like a game from xbox original . i thought id love this game but its all hype atleast fortnite is free and the graphics arnt complete garbage even the map is fing boring ! run for <num> minutes though barren open ground to a already looted building wow so much fun <emoji>
laggy as hell , horrible graphics , and very frustrating . i want my <num> bucks back <emoji>
all you do is crash and die you can never win gun fight bc the hit detection is so i could of shot someone in the face with the shotgun and they wouldnt die then you have the crashing you ldgit cant go two games without crashing its horrible the game is a load of actual human feces
graphics are worst then <num> movement is crap doors suck to open waste of <num>
runs like trash . waste of $ <num>
this game is lit fam . hit me up for dem chicken dinners .
i cant believe how bad this game is . just play fortnite for free . it runs smoother , looks better , loads faster .
if i could do zero stars i would . <num> games in a row on start game crashed . and they probably . dont plan to fix it dont buy wase of money unless its a <num> $game then id say go for it .
if you dont like it go back to playing fortnite ! . itlagstoomuch itcosttoomuch . be patient
this game is a pure joke and certainly not worth $ <num> ! even playing with the xbox one x and a <num> k tv you cant make the difference between a tree and a potential other player , and the lag is terrible considering the fact that i do have fiber inernet in my house ! now keep in mind that pubg is so frugal and so dirt cheap that after playing way over an hour in order to save money and buy your first crate , it is very likely that you will be rewarded with a pink shirt , which is really helpful to survive against aks and rpgs . right ? worse loot system in the video game history ! this game is nothing but a total rippoff and a scam well designed to steal money from us honest players . do not buy !
things id like to see . <num> . you can buy one item to spawn in with with points varying . <num> . have the gille available in the rewards crate . this isnt pc we cant trade clothes or buy from others . <num> . put cool clothes in the reward crate nobody wants a $ <num> dirty tank top like i just got . <num> . give vehicles traction . <num> . a zombie mode . <num> . if you have a med kit you can use it to pick yourself up if downed just make them a little more scarce . <num> . dont go nuts with buyable content . <num> . put out buyable content we want to buy help us help you that <num> dollar thing looks terrible . <num> . shoes that silent foot steps . <num> . a few up armored vehicles with a mounted gun random on the map . <num> . rpgs <num> . sniper bipods <num> . auto glock <num> . shoes that make you run faster <num> . taser <num> . claymore <num> . bear trap . <num> . grenade launcher <num> . a pack of wolves roaming instead of the bombs nobody dies from the bombs . <num> . spint while aim with fore grips . <num> . a message at the least if you think about using one of these ideas from this review .
can i just get a refund ? fortnite is so much better . framerate ruins whole experience i cant believe they force you to pay while fortnite is free .
i want my money back please . nowhere near as smooth as fortnite . very laggy and controls are horrible .
yes , it has its bugs but that is just a symptom of early access . frames will drop and it takes a bit of time to get the controls down but over all its a great game that will only get better as time goes on . get this game while it is still $ <num> . so much fun and the hype behind it is real . go get the chicken dinner !
love the graphics . thanks everybody for the help .
cant even load in , just keeps saying cant connect . not a good start
this game is a complete and utter piece of . every time they update it , they fix <num> minor problem and create at least <num> new problems . the devs have absolutely no idea what they are doing . besides robbing the players . its been <num> months and frame drops during close range gunfights are basically worse than when the game first came out . this game also has the worst dsync i have ever seen in a game . the pubg servers are trash . optimization is a joke . imput lag is atrocious at times . microsoft is a joke for allowing this game to have a $ <num> price rag . anyone still writing <num> star reviews are shilling for bluehole & microsoft . congrats everyone , we paid to be testers for these s game thats gonna be free in a matter of months .
we need more time it and it takes too long to land fix <emoji>
<num> stars at best as is . it will get smoother im sure but ffs . first game <num> minutes in i jump some barrels and got squished between them and the fence , which instakilled me lol .
i paid <num> bucks for it .
people need to get over complaining about this game . its a game preview and it is a work in progress . you need to stop or got play a different game . i enjoy this game for what it is and it is still fun to play . the developers are new to making games and and doing the best they can . give contractive criticism and dont be a sheeple
the frame rate is terrible , the lag makes it unplayable . attempting to get a refund .
it need work but overall i enjoy playing it . to all the negative reviews what part of early access dont you understand .
feels like a cheap rework for xbox aiming is slow even on max sensitivity and we get at most <num> fps but can go lower down to <num> . needed more time and full release comes out in <num> days so it better be fixed by then .
feels like <num> on gamecube . graphics really bad and the guns aim and controls are bad . hitbox is bad too . the division survival mode beat this by a long run . hope the game is unfinished because i waste my money on this card board game .
<num> fps hot garbage xb <num> x seventeen didnt i just buy a <num> <emoji> console to not experience <num> fps ?
fortnite is better . so salty to sue epic . you loose . <emoji> good thing i previewed . so over priced . <emoji>
if this was high school project i would understand . of course its early access , but i truly feel the devs are intentionally messing this game up . there must be an inside joke at bluhole that anyone who purchased this game is an and lets remind them of that .
its straight up garbage couple of updates but its still . btw <num> updates of nothing
play area moves too fast !
runs like crap . an unacceptable release of a game . controls are horrid , terrible graphics . <num> frames per second at best
game concept great . the rush to push the game preview out before christmas was greedy and stupid ! you cant make it thru one match without being dropped . the delves should have made sure the preview ran instead of trying to cash in on christmas . i will encourage anyone i know to never purchase any further titles from this company . anyone know how to get a refund from this super greedy worthless game publisher ! every person that bought this game deserves a refund . if this poor excuse for a company cant provide refunds . all unhappy customers should join together and start a class action lawsuit !
play fortnite . this game has been around forever . battle royale drops out of nowhere and has far less issues . waste of money
it is a game we get to play before its finished your paying <num> the beta and to give ways to make it better it will frequently update be a lil buggy etc but if you bout this not knowing it was going to have some flaws your an idiot do me reasearch b <num> crying about it further more this gam was designed <num> pc so yeah the controls are going to be a lil tuff to master get good plain and simple this game is alot fun alot of laughs and oh moment well worth <num>
no explanation but worth it✌ <emoji>
total waste of money rubbish made popular by chinese propaganda . runs and controls terribly even on x <num> x .
the button layout is not user friendly . the movement is just super clucky . i was very excited for this game . now im just disatisfied . <emoji>
this game is not in anyway <num> k ! it out right lies in the description
its a great game but its choppy and laggy more than any game out . the concept is the only thing people like and its the only game of its kind on console so it will keep selling .
i admit i thought at <num> st trash game but since then i have purchased the xbox one x and a <num> k television and now the game looks and plays amazingly well if your on or have this game and are running it from the <num> yr old out dated xbox one you are not a happy customer and if you have yet to buy pubg and dont have the current xbox system (((wait))) untill this game is a finish product its truly not made right now to be played on a <num> yr old xbox it looks and plays like $µ ! t compared to playing on the most powerful game console to date it is night and day and if you invest in xbox trust me put down the cash on a <num> k television its a must have accessory then and only then buy pubg . i am pointing out this game is the best br type game out on currentnewest console and on a <num> k television it can and does handle <num> frps with perfection and very little to zero console crashing <num> out of <num> .
laggy mess matchmaking takes <num> minutes you load into a game that feels like its running on a cell phone should have never wasted my money its more entertaining to burn toast
so what is the excuse gonna be now that it isnt in preview ? same horrible gameplay but now you can buy useless cosmetics ! this company is a joke and hasnt given a thought about their customers .
it runs like garbage for <num> $ . fortnite is free and is much more user friendly , with devs that actually care about the game . this game seems like a rushed cash grab . yes , i understand its a game preview , but thats not a valid excuse for this pile of garbage .
the only reason why people like this game is because of the hype . do not buy this game . textures take about <num> minutes to load in , servers are not good , and framerate is about <num> fps . do not buy !
game crashes somewhat consistently . lag and framerate issues . after ten updates it still has a lot of the same problems . update <num> . <num> : i just threw $ <num> at a xbox one x and that seems to fix nothing . game looks prettier though ! <emoji> update <num> . <num> : over the last <num> months ive accrued <num> hours into pubg on xbox . after the full release the game is still the buggiest ive ever experienced on console . constant de sync , lag , and still crashes during gameplay among other things . update <num> . <num> : having problems running squads , constantly having to restart the game . desync and lag in most gunfights still . cars flip or explode for no reason . six more days until blackout arrives and i can delete this broken , frustrating game .
it lags the hit detection is you get shot though walls dont buy not even worth a free game
getting better , but still has so many annoying problems
also the only game to be better day <num> than current
the graphics look like my
instead of fixing the game they added more . and their reward system is still stupid as hell , spend <num> k on crate , get a duplicate , exchange value <num> . wth
laggy and crashes , controls also suck
cant get through one game without lagging out . im done playing for a few months . maybe these morons will fix the issues that need to be fixed to make the game actually playable instead of tweaking the characters hair . great game if it was playable . hold on to your $$$ for now at least . update . still lags horribly and lags you out every game . aiming is also horrible as well . these idiots will write these reviews trying to remind you that its a game preview and its not finished yet . we know , you idiots ! people read these to find how the game is , not how its going to be .
game is broken dont waste your money ! you have ben warned . i want my money back <emoji>
worst purchase ive made on xbox and i bought <num> days to die and ark on release . this is garbage compared to fortnite .
no matter how much you like this game , you cant ignore the handfull of problems it has , but the worse of them all is the bad frame drops , rendering , and resolution . these <num> problem give me a splitting headache (especially when driving) and just kills the joy for me . fortnight is free and yet it has way more features and smoother game play ; pubg is <num> $ and has notting (no special gamemodes , daily missions , reachable cosmetics . ) shouldnt it be the other way around ? this may be a game preview but being the only new exclusive xbox has , you would think this game would be better but nope they rather push it out of their to milk the hell out of the holiday season . my first review was much more lenient but they still deleted it . deleting truthful reviews is very shady microsoft , your going to lose more and more people
dont waste your money on this sh@t .
if you like awful games that feel like they were made in the <num> s you might like it <emoji>
this game is gay , very gay .
great idea , great game but trash programmers . major bug needs priority fix is auto closing mid game
constantly getting teamkilled by theses racist people . can never enjoy a match always wondering are thes guys going to teamkill me video proof but i get baned for cursing at them . just got teamkilled at another team was working wwith him . n othing happens to them just the black dude gets banned . garbage land no near no loot search five houses finally get a gun but die from two bullet with a vest a helmet i shoot dude in the face five times but i die from two bullets . fix your game . died again cause every house i go in has nothing bbut pistol grips and pistol ammo but no guns . until enemiesshow up with scars and aks and i get no time to pick up the gun load it and switch frining rate . im dead from two bulets ump vs scar who dies ?
dont be suprised when nothing loads in and you run at <num> fps max
looks like a <num> . no contols layout for newbs . no options menu period . <num> fps at best . mad i bought this pos
its a good game but they need to disable team kill , i get tire of team mates killing you to get your guns . why do games allow team killing anyways , dumb mfs .
still experience some lagging and game crashes but improving weekly .
for the love of god take the desert map off desync is awful , now with latest patch everything on the xbox one x is darker and the brightness o nly turns the constrast up and does nothing towards the dark spots everywhere on both maps
fix nameplates . fix fps . fix footsteps .
why fully release the game its still broken , i love firing <num> rounds from a <num> to see in spectator mode only a quarter of his health is gone .
garbage , buildings load slowly and merge your character into them . buy something else .
if you dont buy this game you are gonna miss out on one of the best games this year and next year . fxck fortnite
nothing short of a mix of games that have been out for years with regurgitated left <num> dead graphics . if you like completely unoriginal things , go ahead and dump your money into this joke that is somehow even less funny than destiny <num> .
first off the game is not that fun to play . very boring , extremely slow , choppy , laggy and im running this on xbox one x would not recommend to anyone . ill stick to fornite <emoji>
performance is terrible , cant even hold <num> fps on the x due to spaghetti cpu . dont buy until they fix it .
i paid $ <num> and cant even play .
bs got it as a gift wish i could return or exchange it . gave a chance for almost a month even with updates game is over hyped and trash and yes i do realize its in preview but it just makes me rage more than im having fun . dont waste your time and money
the most stupidest control is u have to push lt two time to aim in first person
. still has a very long way to go but i have only crashed once since yesterday and i feel like that is a good way to progress the games development . also the new setting help alot . maybe the next update could better optimize the game . i think that would be a great next update . this is not my final review .
a game that gives or makes you : excitement , wonder , anger , anxious , joy , fear , scared , destroyed by loss of good loot ! best mp game changer since arma series
dont even bother . just go play fortnite instead . its worth more than this sorry excuse of a game .
gimme my wasted money back
todos se la pasan corriendo , te disparan cuando acabas de aparecer desde las ventanas o puertas , se salen del edificio o casa para matarte , jugar de esa forma según es de pros y según es jugar de forma competitiva , este juego dejo de ser táctico <num> meses despues de su estreno , ahora es un shooter del monton . no lo compren , se terminaran hartando de los jugadores toxicos .
this game has got worse and worse throughout the months ive played it . i suck at this game but i usually am the only player doing anything in gold ranks . the team balancing is so bad that half of the games i play by myself or with a friend we have to carry people to the point whee by round two i will have <num> kills and every body in my squad has <num> or less kills . so many broken thing like glaz or getting kicked from a ranked game even though you your ping is under <num> . this game isnt bad but bad development choices and random buffing to operates who dont need it or just glitchs that should be fixed . it is an ok game if you have <num> man squad and luck on you side . it can acctually be fun then . p . s(you should be able to kick people from ranked if they have <num> + damage to the team , and make it two rounds pass and someone leaves replace them with a different player , but make it balanced and if losing stat loss prevention)
for skilled players ? oh its a great game ! from someone who played regularly , this game is cancer . the community team kills over characters , even in ranked . not to mention the crosshairs are bugged as fak . put the cross hair of a single fire ump over a targets face , one in multiplayer then tested in custom game , even ads semi auto , missed <num> out of <num> . mind you we aimed at the target , didnt input , no ghoststick , just flat on nose . so i hate call of duty , but i would rather play advanced warfare . n that game , to me , suuuuuuuuuuucked ! but at least my hitmarkers register . failure thy name is siege
im tired of having to constantly uninstall and then redownload this game because of a glitch that makes me unable to do anything because it glitches out the camera to some out of bounds area and im unable to see where my character is going or what doing , i would not recommend you waste money on a game like this thats just gonna break
now granted i enjoy playing this game and being paired with good people , but when you have friends like i do who exclude you from every game , teamkill , and vote you out . then i dont like it . thats been year <num> for me , and now with year <num> coming out here soon . i fear thats going to be the same . i just need better friends , so if anyone is cool and wants to hit me up , do so . i need better people to play rainbow with for year <num> .
when salty peopl team kill , glich , ect . its so hard to play . also , if you dont get season pass <num> new operator cost <num> , <num> renown . ridiculs ! fix the whole game ! it looks nothing like the trailer ! ubisoffixseige
this game reminds me why i hate first person shooters and it makes it a double whammy cause its also a ubisoft game i will never play another first person shooter again if you play a tom clancy game stick with the division and splinter cell or ghost recon .
it definitely was a great game , up until everyone bought the season <num> pass . now they wasted money for absolutely nothing . its really sad when they canceldelay the dlc for season <num> after everyone bought the passes . its a complete scam , id love a refund , but we all know that wont happen . recommend the game . however do not buy the season passes you will not get anything for season <num> pass !
princess stamos cant get monopoly property and therefore is a boy
the problem with this game is when you start playing multyplayer you dont get paired up with people your the same level as so you fight high level players . all of the actually good classes you have to buy the season pass for so that sucked . then theres all of these bugs like on free weekend you couldnt play multyplayer . but overall its alright , if your actually good .
i love this game truly . but since hibana and echo were added , ive been dissapointed . i meaan hibanas great . but can you tell me what the point of echo is ? every map seems like its made to his disadvantage , especially the new one . you cant bring the drone outside at all and you arent even allowed to scan enemies with it . his gun sucks and the only good thing about him is that he looks cool . and on top of that , his yokai is horrible . you have to be so precise in order for it to work and it deosnt recharge fast enough . either he needs to be removed or the maps need to be updated . and i found a bug with frost . it was on bank and i jumped through one of the windows and destroyed the bear trap , it gave me the <num> points , and then i got downed with a bear trap on me somehow . fix it
. its a good game but pay more money for season pass year two i dont like it at all <emoji>
i have all the operators and unlocked , but now some reason i dont have him and i said oh thats not a big deal . ill just buy him back . so im going to go buy him back right and guess what theyre more expensive so i cant buy him back . and the other guy and that guy , but i cant get them either why the hell you taking my operator
multiplayer is alright , terrorist hunt is better . extremely lacking offlinelocal multiplayer terrorist hunt unlike vegas <num> (which i loved) . campaign would have been nice as well . feels incomplete like titanfallevolve without one . it also needs a lot of work with balancing , it gets ridiculous when im shot through two walls by someone spraying a shotgun or when im shot immediately at the start of a round .
great to see ubisoft getting greedy with year two season pass and making players who dont have it wait <num> days to unlock the operators . along with year <num> dlc characters being overpowered , this game is just spawn rushing paytowin . and even casual is horrible now , when a team loses <num> or <num> rounds people just rage quit and now its a <num> v <num> with no fair way to win , along with ranked players level <num> playing casual like its ranked and spawn trapping ruining the game , and then smurf accounts going all recuit shotguns and nitro cells . this game went from fun and entertaining to survival of the sound wh <emoji> res
operation health is nearly finished , and its developers have yet to relieve their game of its major issues . such as : serverconnectivity problems (random disconnections) , ingame mechanics (hit boxes and balancing) , and more . for a game that has been out for <num> years , and one that has a blooming community , it funnels out into just an addition to ubisofts recent collection of generic , let downofagame .
i was waiting for so long for operation white noise to come out for xbox then it did <num> day later the update is done its nothing but lag when its not my internet and the most unfair operator guns ! why ubisoft ! the new operators seriously need a nerf its not even fun to get shot in the chest by one of them and die instantly from it ! <emoji>
i go to shoot people but on thir screen i dont shoot them at all . also the game freezing has to stop . theres also countless number of times where hit detection sucks and it gets me killed constantly .
do you enjoy hating your free time ? does your job not frustrate you enough ? are you a masochist ? then this the game for you ! it will punish you like dark souls . and the best part is that it will be a real person who punishes for even trying to play this game . save your money for something enjoyable
freezes way to much . reminds me of the old school nintendo console . then it opens a random app . im not sure if its the game or the xbox , but my other games dont do this
rainbow six vegas <num> is a great game so why was everything that made it so good was taken out or replaced . online the r <num> s is decent , but reminds me of call of duty , offline terrorist hunt has no ai team or co op same console multiplayer , no storymode . this is disappointing
tired of ubisofts infrastructure and season <num> , <num> , <num> , <num> bs . buyer beware . this franchise is a cash grab off of a once great game series . my year <num> dlc disappeared for no reason . cant redownload it !
this the greatest game to come out since tic tac toe ! if you like to spray and pray , snick and snack , and chew some gosh darn good bubblegum , this is the game for you ! pros : shoot like a pro gangsta saving damsel in distress fight tooth and nail for victory shoot through stuff shoot your teammate the graphics are beyond this world , makes my fatback telly like a hd hidef tellyvision . it just blew my mind . cons : you cant use a wounded enemy as a meat shield . you cannot hide in closets no weapon pickups no arresting the bad guys no arresting teammates no handheld taser cannot remove clothing conclusion : i can play this game for eons , this game is some soul shattering stuff , siege will take you on a feels rollocoasta . making you question everything . like is that teammate going to shoot me ? hes aiming right at my face . this game will teach you about life ! like how wood is bulletproof or how falling <num> feet can incarcerate you game set match dope ! yeaaaah dooooug
too start , i love this game but having to spend money on another season pass is bs , even for ubisoft .
boring game with severe unrealistic qualities for a game that claims tons of realism . the game has hardly any true custimization options for the charactersclasses . never actually played the pvp , but cant imagine it being very good since all the game modes are variations of cods search and destroy . i did play quiet alot of terrorist hunt and the situations ; the enemy ai goes from a god to complete retard at times , sometimes within seconds . the lack of a true story mode kills any leftover interest that i may have had . to be honest i never would have played this game if it wasnt free to play for a weekend because i had heard such bad things about it when it came out .
im in gold and i get put agaisnt plats wtf
siege vegas games were super ! this game having no one player storyline is a travesty . too bad multiplayer is ruining most of the series out there .
this game has been in development for many years but you would i have a better chance of finding a cure for cancer than playing a game without roamers . the matchmaking system is a steaming pile of . im not even ranked but i still get place against level <num> s and diamonds . i give this one star because i have been playing this game for a span of <num> years but have not seen a improvement in gameplay . why does there always have to be a roamer on the enemy team . everygame i played there was a roamer . do not buy this stinky pile of horse diarrhea .
very challenging game , communication is a must . time spent learning the game is very rewarding in the long run . great game just be ready to invest some time to get the full sweaty palm <num> round edge of your seat expirence .
porly designed and there seems to be no management . quit what your doing a make paperclips instead . fuall
this game is awful it is not woth the money save youre money you die way to easy <emoji> its awful i regret paying for this game
i hate it how there forceing you to get the season pass i am done
didnt get season <num> pass i paid for
r <num> wont update no matter anything ive done , i literally reset my console and the only solution ive found is to uninstall and reinstall which is <num> gb everytime this is the third time ive done that
i bought the game on sale in the microsoft store , with season pass and <num> year gold . but they didnt give me game coins it said they will come with !
have not played many games online where teams were not imbalanced from drop offs , kicks , late game insertions , or poor connection , game lag . beware the console version is not on par with pc where these issues are resolved .
save your money this game very porly done , hit boxs are out of this world some guns are way better than the other , save your self the rage and stay away from this game , theres also little money grabers if you wanna look cool , like wouldnt you just love to look like a clown or maybe a bright yellow bannana ? well they cost abot <num> bucks , you cant say im only writing this cuz im bad well im platinum so , and dont get me starded on the jerks who play this game
this game its too toxic every game i go into i get tk . even in ranked everything is broken . how is this fair no ranks players vs plats and gold . do not waste your money on this old y game it has <num> years out and it still sucks
to what used to be a good game . cant play new map , bugs out everytime .
so theres team kills trolls killing then quitting so they dont get penalized . you can accidently kill teammates multiple times takes one bullet , c <num> , grenade , charge and all because they want to run in your line sight . then you get penalized which only goes up . i got ban <num> min . first time <num> days later another accident <num> hours i read reviews about penalty and now im deleting the game because that is total b . s . i make sure i tried my hardest not to teamkill but it cant always be helped with something that is meant to be fast paced and people with no skill thinking they are rambo its going to happen and youre at fault . how does a company ban you from a game you pay for to begin with ? so i spend my hard earned money to basically help your company grow to not being able to play cause you say so tell me how does that make sense . reknown system takes forever unless you spend more of your money . to new people dont buy a game that you cant play freely . this is one of them !
trash garbage trash garbage shield+shield+shield+shotgun with sniper accuracy trash trash trash trash zero balance . game makes no sense . teammates are worthless . ubisoft is nothing but a bunch of foreign . and as for the division . pretty much same thing . oh and zero servers not worth the money no ubisoft game ever is .
if you like call of duty , you would like this game . furthermore , you cannot leave spawn without getting killed , on attack , most defenders just roam , so if you like getting spawned killed , get this game .
very addictive , super fun , worth your money , some glitches though
they need to fix the hit box and need some form of macth making for casual (mabey by level and k . d)
call of duty bs on steroids . ubisoft made a game where its all about trick shots and compleley unrealistic fighting . no weapon sway , you pretty much have to get a headshot because of ridiculous running around corners again and again , some characters move at near light speed while fighting .
my seasons . pass dont work
purchased day one of the free weed and as of today havent been able to connect at all . the best i get are the situations and there offline love to know if the problem is on my end but have yet . to find a solution either in forums or from ubisoft support . paid for offline situations . great game ubi .
i spent <num> bucks on a slow paced game with limmited customizatiion , pay to win , team balancing sucks , no story , not good game modes , you rage too much , and overall not enjoyable at all
the replays show a different clip from wat really happens , the aim assist . in this game is to crazy , has had tons of updates but the multiplayer is still in beta after <num> or <num> years of being out wat is goin on , get killed wen u move out of the line of sight , long story short its addictive but not worth it to a real shooter
<num> nd match i ever played and people tried to team kill me lol good bye <emoji> ✌
its so bad , if youre like me and you like competive if you get social banned like me atm you cant communicate all characters half to be unlocked its done poorly unlike for honor or palaidins you die way to fast and you need to wait <num> minutes to respawn the characters dont fit in terrorist hunt is a bad gamemode they crapped out their is basically no campaign the ranking system is boring no one picks right choices they dont care if they loose in compt and youre stuck in the worst rank cause of that everything melts even the handguns dont waste youre money buying bo <num> or iw and going to play hardcore snd would be the same but enjoyable with and without friends
