the guns are so inconsistent i can't build sometimes and if i can they can somehow shoot through it building noises do not occur sometimes when i first land and pick up a gun it acts as if im holding an invisible pick axe very good game <emoji>
join the pubg master race
i have been playing since the first day and i still get on fortnite every day people don't understand that they are hating on a free to play game and complaining about the current metta <emoji>
epic games does not know how to handle a game everything is unbalanced and stuff that needs to be nerfed gets buffed and everything that needs to be buffed gets nerfed and this game is mostly on luck not skill
worst game i have ever played
the game suddenly freezes your character when in battle every now and then then your dead fix this issue and multiple others this game is broken and the people who play are just annoying well your just playing your game and you have all good loot you might just come across a bush camper or someone using a double pump the most broken thing ever pump do alot of damage but there are those times where you hit a guy for <num> damage and he one shots you sooooo many problems must be fixed in order for a decent game sorry epic i love your games and all but theres just something about this one that gets me <emoji> oh and lower the vbucks prices <num> $ for <num> thing is disappointing now i come back and update this after <num> weeks and its just disappointing i have friends i play with me we all have the same glitch where we cant pull out our gun ! its annoying ! when im landing and some other player decides to land next to me i pick up my weapon try to pull it out nothing happens im done
guns are broken he graphics are terrible the skins are useless just delet the game the will never bring playground if so im reporting it
ahhhhhh whystraight copy of ddlc ! ginger gunner is sayori like y ? also in titled towers u can actully see sayori dead ! yuri always gets her fire ball jutsu and kills u ! she then fricken eats your wepons ! in moisty mire monika always gets her keyblade and beats u toooooo death ! natsuki is always watching fullmetal alchy ! and says "manga is love manga is life" ! nuuuuuuu ! monika has magic penis power and kills ! im done they ruined ddlc ! <emoji> <emoji>
updated <num> start of april ( <num> months after release) now and it still gets <num> stars they just keep adding more stuff to the game that no one wants and has no use they should be fixing prior issues and problems not adding more come on the gun play is getting better but still just rushers with shotguns <num> of the time all these rifles and never a chance to use them lol they also continue to mess up the game every update they put out <num> step forward <num> steps back they clearly want money with their overpriced cosmetics i mean seriously $ <num> $ <num> for just <num> skin ! wow if epic put more time into solving game issues and not pumping out battle passes and overpriced skins then maybe ill give them more stars untill then nope
were do i start ? this game is garbage riddled with microtransactions and dosnt even say anywere on the xbox version that its going to be free to play in a couple months tutorial is about <num> hours long yes hours its way too easy and building a fort is basically useless because you can just throw a couple walls up and be fine and you dont get your recources back at the end of the game not to mention it takes forever grinding for those recources do not buy this game it sucks and you will regret it
the crafting part of the game is ridiculous and is not needed and the game looks like a cartoon ! you shoot someone and all of a sudden thier building a huge and tall fort ! i don't get it !
this game is for autistic babies with nothing to do but waste their college funds on nothing more but virtual trash so stop buying virgin bucks and get outside reminder it rips off the pubg
i like winnning i also like the <num> percent accuracy also you only hate it because your trash
the game is complete trash poor player base and mechanics
good game but servers are horrible
they need to stop updating battle royalefake pubg and start working on save the world
give us everything for free
game is full of scrubs and <num> year olds i wish i could have rated this game <num> stars i played while waiting for pubg to come out and i'll never go back i hope that metor wipes out the entire game and not just tilted towers
i wanna love this game its so much fun but epic wtf this is such a poorly developed game it gives me the runs srsly stop adding and fix this game plz for the love of gods honestly <num> star game from a <num> star company oh btw the game should run better after a maintenance and yet every time they "fix" something the game runs worse trash trash trash epic games can eat a well you get it
i had <num> armor and <num> health and died by <num> bullet to the chest
i am autistic but i still like this game
with minimum microtransactions consistent updates fortnite is free to play if you chose but skill gap is a problem personally but practice makes perfect
before you mark this unhelpful let me explain this is the most laggy game i have ever played the lag is worse than cod running off of mcdonald's wifi also you could find the best assualt rifle in a matter of minutes or it could take you ten minutes to just to find a pistol my point is this game has way to many luck factors in it and please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions if you fixed the game like this i would give the game four out of five stars update jan <num> still garbage the game has gotten much worse the silenced pistol is way overpowered you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone also shotguns are still overpowered lower their damage i tryed pubg and at least that game has balanced health and weapon damage plus there are no shield potions to be found in pubg update jan <num> lag is fixed so heres <num> stars shotguns are still way overpowered i have no more room left so <emoji>
great shooting i love unlimited sprint cool crafting mechanics single ques duos and team ques although some lagfps hiccups & some minor bugs imo this is the best battle royale on consoles rn <emoji>
this game is one of the best games ive played in quite a while and its not even finished i genuinely cant wait for its full free release in <num>
never got a chance to play bc the wont launch pubg doesn't have these issues fortnite !
the best battle royale game ever pubg sucks and fortnite rules <emoji>
it may be just like pubg but i think its better <emoji> the cartoon look is amazing <emoji> ‍ <emoji> but not only that because they keep updates regularly so you always have something to look forward to <emoji> they also added building and i think the building is one of the best things about this game the game is still in beta so its fine with some glitching they just need to make it less luck base <emoji> but other than that great game epic games one of the greatest games so far ⚔
garbage laggy as hell plus i got a <num> damage with a blue pump from point blank then got <num> shot by a green pump please learn how guns work irl and fix your poopy gun logics <emoji>
i always get double triple quad or quint
not fun and impossible to win
dont like the dab or that fact of friendships being destroyed ? how could epic games go from gears to this trash ?
you play stupid game get nothing but stupid rank also stupid is little kids begging thier parents to buy stupid costumes and stupid emotes stupid game its just stupid too many updates
(edit : gameroffaith <num> pls read carefully b <num> u send me comments again nowhere in this rant did i say fortnight stole the battle royale genre from pubg pubg didnt invent that genre h <num> z <num> did) drop in spawn eye of the storm ? pubg u just gonna let a rich company that came up with the unreal engine and gears of war screw u by dropping their game first on console and for free loaded with microtransactions ? lawsuit is surely needed for those <num> yr old to <num> yr olds who force there parents to support this free to play garbage f'off this is a careless ripoff of what pubg has founded not the battle royale genre but the drop in spawn and the forced movement of the eye of the storm sad to see a rich huge company like epic games result to stealing ideas from at the time a indie company but sadder to see people back this stealing from a much smaller francise ! this cant be supported by gamers u r helping a rich company fattin their pockets by screwing the little guy <emoji>
so the people of india can't play fortnite on xbox ? common xbox and epic games i bought the console to play fortnite you guys ruined all the excitement it's a great game and i am not getting to play it since i live in india i hope you will fix this problem
i can't wait for this game but i really hope you put in difficulty modes to make the game really hard
this game will never die <emoji>
fun <num> of the time <emoji>
why do people not like this game
game is fun for <num> day then its just me landing and dying do not waste time to download also the only way to get vbucks is to pay for them which is over priced or pay a stupid amount for an add on save the world game abselute crap
dis game doo doo nah jk love it keep it up epic
when u realize your original pve game is trash and got no sales so u gotta copy pubg
put aside the bugs glitches and lag ts a great game i love playing this with my friends even if <num> of the time we lose all of the <num> year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop as this game deserves at least <num> stars the shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know as well as some other serious problems like stw scammers and lag if you are under <num> years of age you probably shouldn't play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some <num> year old tryhard so for the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are <num> or older try to not think about the glitches and other cons and just have fun i also highly recommend buying save the world but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed great game <num> stars from me
i love the game i just want save the world for free
this game sucks so much i hope the creators die by a gunshot to there ugly mf face pubg is gonna kill this cartoonish game dont play this game its filled with degenerate nerds who have big gay
so i rush a kid with double green pump and each of my shots do <num> damage and all headshots especially the lag makes it worse
man ! this game is great yes the v bucks are totally over priced but no said u have <num> buy them those people who are all like ''fort nte sucks '' r just up set because they suck the game is a great game its very unique <emoji> plus its free just try it if u dont like it delete it <emoji>
hurry up with playground mode <emoji>
i like how its free and all but it makes it free so you can spend money in game kids get addicted to skins even though just sticking to default is fine and plus if you waste youre money on skins theres a chance you might be seen in combat so whats the point of buying it im here to say this game is trash and its my opinion
pubg is a way better game for pc fortnite is a <num> yo tryhard magnet pubg is way more realistic and dosent have <num> yos breaking controllers and spamming a to jump fortnite is sht
keeps logging me out in the middle of matches this game is trash
the game in itself is good but it gets <num> much credit the game has lag issues plus the whole game is <num> luck based there's not much skill when someone has a purple ar that ends u in <num> shot compared <num> a green peashooter ar that takes <num> headshots <num> gun somebody down plus the mapchest weapon drops r <num> consistent in some areas there r plenty of skilled players in the game but almost everyone knows where the best loot chest r on the map it makes the game <num> uneven plus this game is a squeaker paradise <emoji>
does you're game have negative to ok reviews ? no problem ! instead of working on the base game so every mission doesn't feel the same just try to capitalize on pubg's popularity <num> for fortnite <num> for battle royale
the graphics and i don't like is that you cannot change your appearance of your character
epic screwed up bringing back skull trooper updating this game so much who agrees fortnite is dieing remember the old days like they show in the trailer who misses when building wasnt your biggest concern and rember whe all of you who played in season <num> how there was tac sub grey pump purple tac now its whoever canget to that scar i remember my first win when i bush camped and got that snipe and ended someone with a green ar near dusty depot they need to stop adding crap and repair dust and brind back that smg you won your first game with over at moisty or how you <num> pumped a sqaud with a grey pump i say bring back the good days
this game is trash i could watch old people try to suck their toes and get better gameplay than this heaping pile of trash
fortnite is laggier than subnautica i get that its a big game and there are gonna be bugs but the lag is unbearable if you get to a building and you get a gun you might encounter another player that player might have a gun if you want to kill the player you will increase your chances of the kill if you fire first but if lag comes in you might lose the lag is issued by player so it will hit you in short bursts
this game is the cancer of the internet and will just end up like minecraft did its unfun to new players trying to play the game and other platforms have unfair advantages due to mobile haveing the option to see sound and pc has quicker aim it the most unfun game i have ever played and its just going to get worst even <num> year olds are playing the game might as well get the hole minecraft comunity over here then this game is cancer and is going to burn i can already see it now aus fandoms under age players every were so go ahead go play a game that you cant even play because a player is going to kill you before you even start and the game has already started to generate dank memes and and if you did win good for you your another loser without a life
i love this game every update adds better graphics and awesome weapons keep it up !
anyone who says this game is boring doesnt have enough intelligence to completely rock this game it's not just tower defend missions this game has more game modes than overwatch each map load contains different terrain which gives some really interesting defend builds this keeps you on your crafting toes if you play just five hours than you still haven't learned everything yet honestly you were probably in the tutorial but you thought you were playing the game i completed chapter <num> which is huge and get rewarded with more game types makes me wonder if there will be even more to come to truly challenge the player on final chapter
this game is very popular but i don't see how doing the same thing over and over again is fun
also it's to popular and overrated <emoji> agree <emoji> disagree
decent game though its a pubg rip off with major lag on servers you die before ever knowing you are in a gun fight because of laggy servers
i would say it's a nice game for kids since it's free but it promotes unrealistic violence ! if you play this please do us both a favor and block me because our mental state and capacity aren't on the same level chop some rocks to build yourself a fort let it be your tomb✌
i need vbucks and refunds
well it got great but since they decided to go <num> fps its back to lagging not to mention they expect you to play as good as a pc player with new cross platform play try killing a pc player with the hardcore lag xbox just ruined the game now its not letting me enter the game pubg is a better i recommend it over this
think you could add any more confusing menus charts webs and currencies ? update <num> the introduction of the battle royale mode has considerably increased the playability of this game the original game playing against zombies is still crap
this game is for kids freeplay has little rewards building ruins combat get pubg for real strategic combat
it's not everything the internet hypes it to be if this isn't your cup of tea then don't play it
i got this game because pubg was laggy and full of desync i had heard better about this game thats all wrong if you're looking for battle royale just get pubg
the amount of tryhards in this game makes it impossible to play for casuals or noobs like me but it is possible to have fun however there is one thing wrong they lock cool visual upgrades behind the battle passvbucks microtransactions if you can'twon't buy them they will send annoying emails telling you to buy it
this game is garbage it supposed to be so big and the best game but you cant play it with new update there never good loot and the players are hackers fix your epic this game is trash
having a smallish map with <num> people is ridiculous along with this there are sometimes where you would land right in the beginning and walk into a house to see someone already in there with a shotgun that one shots you this hasn't happened once or twice its like every <num> games you will have this problem along with this the rng is very annoying you could be at some place like anarcy acres where you can search a house to only get bullets and bandages but the other house gets a green shotgun <num> white rifle and some grenades furthermoreif you survivehe first <num> minutes i hope you have fun running around trying to either find people to kill or some better gear the only good feeling you can get is from winning everything else will be frustration i hoped you liked this review overall if you're good at pvp then have at it but if not then don't bother keeping this game in the storage in your xbox one update : the game has become overrated and its minecraft survival games wguns
this game was running fine until just recently on the pve side literally just lost all my inventory and ability to build stuff the game lags every <num> seconds every new daylag new player joins lag swarm of zombies lag giving players xp boostlag this game is a grinder it used to be fun for me but now its just unplayable
fix your broken game <num> damage headshots face to face with a rare pump shotgun you have to land at named areas to get good loot i feel your hitpoints for gun damage is randomized the graphics are decent cosmetics are ok overall gameplay is below average and the theme for season <num> is lame make <num> v <num> a standard game mode overall the game is pretty bad the servers are mw <num> has better servers than this game
gameplay is fun when it works servers crash ever other day and when they are up your game lobby will crash <num> of the way through it is nice that when you log back in not all is lost no instead of the rewards earned you get a level <num> chest with booty in it so many times over it truly is a huge waste of time
the game is really laggy and glitchy
i am not going to talk about how the game is broken because we all know that but when is save the world gonna be free ? and why do outfits cost <num> to <num> dollars ? i feel like it is just because they want more money for a ripoff of pubg fun for a while but gets boring rpg is op shooting through walls is a new update <num> star
this game is overrated as the combat is and it ruined any chance of any new fps games having a good multiplayer
really epic yesterday i was soo excited ill today i go online and my battle pass is gone if u can do it for me my account is jaleel swag boy all caps no numbers
i pretty much thought this game would be kinda fun to play after i played it for like an hour it sucked dick the map is too small it's a pubg rip off and there's too many players in the match the guns are just horrible there just for tryhards and you can't even pick what you want your character to look like every players a dick and that's pretty much it from the game is a piece of and i hate it plus you have to buy one the modes like what the hell are you angry money bastard so please kill yourself & delete this game while you're at it you fag gut
i hate everything about this game everything in this game is op nerf everything stop people spamming tilted and also just make save the world free
only fun part is gliding around in the glider at the beginning looking at the view of the pretty island chopping trees is cool and all to until somebody with a stupid gamertag ruins it all by shooting me its i am going back to farmville to grow plants in peace
the game is good but could you give free vbucks because i dont have any pls my name is washingb i on xbox pls send my vbucks like <num> vbucks pls
ive been wating for this game forever and it finally came out !
i hate ths game ! dont install it ! play playerunkowns battlegrounds
the hype is not real
gamers like it and don't like so why not ? <emoji>
it is so fun i do not want pubg to sue epic games if they do will we get are money back and i want epic games to updating the game because it is so friken fun
i just waited <num> minutes to say it failed then it wants me to wait another <num> no way in hell is that happening fix the game or better yet stop f it up well i waited again and now it says <num> min
this game requires no skill all luck back then we had games like mw <num> and mw <num> look what we're stuck with now i had more fun in <num> days playing blackout than in this minecraft generation game good job epic <emoji>
ihave been playing fortnite for about a year and lemme tell you its amazing the controls are easy to learn and whhen playing the sreen is not crowded with info like a lot of some other pvp games because the game is not close to being donethough fn has frequent updates which make the gameplay smoother and better some people complain of lag but after a full year i only encountered one laggy moment that lasted about <num> seconds i highly recommend that you play this game and experience the awesome community strategy and fun gameplay may you get the wins
its just a bad ripoff of pubg
how im finna get better if i get killed before i can practice ? add leagues
best free game on the market pubg runs terrible and is boring give this a try with friends and have fun
this game gives me sleep paralysis from boredom its the same process over and over
this game is not very good it is rng its mostly wandering not very original and is boring oh yeah never has a sharp metal object been so pitiful the games positives are occasionally being fun it is satisfying to win and you have nothing to lose cause its free oh yeah i lag less in call of duty wwii
completely awful hit detection and imbalanced weapons provides no unlockable content or reason to continue to play
anyone who plays fortnite is a <num> yr old little kid
your system doesnt find my live account
this game is super addicting ! the graphics are perfect everything is great but many things : <num> lag it doesn't happen often but when it happens it fks up your whole game you can't shoot it freezes and the glitches are annoying <num> campaign isn't the greatest don't waste money on it <num> battlepass switches to early <num> party issues (disconnection errors lag etc) <num> <num> type of map <num> innacurate damage <num> vbucks are expensive (just like <num> k) <num> reloading is slow <num> people hack <num> uncustomizable weapons <num> servers are like <num> k <num> updates are to frequent <num> no firstperson option <num> no enemy signal <num> slurp juice shotguns and silenced pistols are overspawned <num> to cheezy not great elements used <num> no vehicles <num> not much modes <num> there should be an option for <num> or <num> people in a party <num> no customizablecreator skins
every <num> in the reviews saying the game is trash are just mad cause they suck epic has done an amazing job keeping this game balanced and they release something in the game that's broken or op they quickly patch and balance it keep it up epic yall are always gonna have haters cause no matter how good some <num> is there is always some <num> better so instead of taking the l like and going on with their lives they get salty and blame it on epic
i did all this work just to get the game to see why my friends like it so much but i cant even access it on my laptop ridiculous
the game just freezes then boots you out
novel idea frustrating game play with glitches in every aspect time to delete again after <num> <num> <num> update
kid cartoon trash the boogie bomb need i say more i play big boy games with my big boy pants on if you think your good at pvp because of this game thats really sad
title says it all battlegrounds looked more interesting than this
alway makes me wait an hour to <num> mins an rips me off when i bought the sarter pack only gave me <num> v bucks not <num> v bucks and always kicks me out of game
every time i have to deal with people that don't use their brains it's not even funny when you only get teamed up with people that hardly use it or even use their eyes or ears are you in there that feel ? but something only i don't like is that ? i have to put all the time
where are the free meme skins ?
get an ar and shoot someone in the back all other guns are pea shooters stealth not included
it was advertised as an open world survival fort builder but its not its a mission based defence game where you constantly run out of ammo and farm materials for about <num> minutes before you start a mission so if you are looking to throw away <num> dollars and waste a large amount of time this is the game for you
too many teleporting cheaters and invisible trapspoor game in general do not recommend
best game ever all you haters are just trash at the game
i wish they did not add rocket launcher because people use them alot and it does alot of damage sometimes my game lags when people kill me with a rocket launcher <emoji>
trash physics doesn't work at all this game is retarded
its all pay to win im not going to be one of those idiots who waste all of their money on skins the whole game is formed around micro transactions and then the community shames people for not wasting their all their money
building is awesome gets updated frequently and new weapons every few weeks and amazing skins save the world is my vbucks giver takes time and practice to get skilled at the game and map gets updated not like pubg with no campain and like other shooters not like fortnite most played game i played and if you think overwatch is fun muselk played it and is playing fortnite pubg no good skins if you think mouse is best with speed you can change sensitivity
its good pugb sucks get good
i cant get in on pc
ok the loading screen takes forever to load it takes <num> : <num> go load thats longer than gta v ok now the lag like i havd really good wifi and i still lag its really bad lag like really bad ive died so much times of lag that its unbelieveable but anythin else the game is fine
its a good game but they have a lot of fixing to do a shot gun to the face up close should be a instant kill not <num> damage especially if they have <num> sheld and heath you have to shoot somebody in the head <num> times with a shotgun if they have <num> sheld and health witch is completely retar if your lucky its <num> shots and there dead other wise if they kill you and you see there heath most likey they have <num> health or lower i dont know about you but when you shoot somebody in the head it should be an instant kill not <num> shots to the head with a shotgun later
this game is pure honestly the servers never work and when your about to get a win you get some massive lag which is annoying because then you loose or die so honestly screw this retarded game
you can see the improvements keep it up !
this game is not fun and a waste of space the only reason im rating one star is because i cant rate zero stars !
well first off i just want to say i love this game ever since the fortnightmare's update there hasnt been almost any lag second of all fnbr is not in beta if you were to buy early access to the save the world your game would still be titled fnbr i'm not sure why though all i know is fnbr is not in beta and it doesnt have much yet but its an amazing game <num>
the game has little lag and you can tell the creators love their game but even still its the developers seem to want to cater to new players shotguns were nerfed so that beginers wouldnt be killed as fast materials are even harder to collect so that players dont have to worry about enemies outbuilding them c <num> is very powerfull so that if you are getting outbuilt you can knock it all down and reset the playing field smg's were buffed so that if you arent accurate at all you could still spray and prayllamas were nerfed severely so that materials are harder to come byrockets were removed from llamas and capped so that if you were a slow builder you didnt need to worry about an endless barage of rockets and according to rummors there is going to be a materials cap so that expert builders cant do as much they are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side showbut its not all bad knewsyou can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of <num> $
the game requires you to listen to your surroundings and keep a watchful eye out for other players that wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for the amount of lag that comes with it preventing sniper shots sneak attacks fair firefights not to mention audio cuts that prevent you from hearing other players there is also some poor damage consistency where you could use the same weapon as another hit each other in the head but you'll be the one to die and he'll escape basically unharmed
so this just a kids version of pubg but it is a good game
everytime i start the game it crashes
a broken game shotgun dmgs glitch and do <num> dmg and loot system is broken
it's straight garbage minecraft is better than this !
i just got the ultimate deluxe edition and it wont even let me play now
any game where you can buy your rank instead of earning it through hours of grinding deserves negative stars
its <num> : <num> am and istill can't access the game im still hyped though
it crashes on the loading screen when i try to start the game up it turns to black screen then takes me back to the home screen
this game is boring and based on luckit gets on my nerves you shoulda put out save the world firstyou developers need to work on stw more or this game will become pure ! im waiting (still) for save the world to be available for free for now <emoji> this game <emoji>
but the people hating are playing the wrong mode pvp is trash
i hate playing the game by myself because every time i get either double triple or quad teamed in solo ! it is so inferiating ! and if you are a starting player it does not care the game will put you up against no lives ! other than that good quality gameplay and graphics
take the new minigun out its not even fair when using it against others bases this game is trash how do you hit someone thats right in front of you for <num> health with a green pump ("the best gun it the game")
fortnite is what you get if you combined pubg world style and combat with minecrafts fun building and overwatch's skins except fortnite manages to make it all suck i know its my opinion but i don't believe this game deserves all the praise it got and is still getting
i dont like the tier system and it sucks and the coomunity are justt trolls and just the whole game !
one of the best games out ! foget about pubg fortnite willl change that trust
i like the game it is cool
in response to sarcha <num> pubg is far better than fortnite if something is hard to be good at then it means you need skill to be good at it fortnite is easy because <num> of the players are middleschoolers who dont have anything better to do pubg is better than fortnite <emoji>
so what this god damn game is telling me is that could have <num> hp and <num> sheild and the other can have <num> hp if i shoot him with a scar ith all my ammo they dont die and if they shoot me once with a lil pump i die this game needs another update and if you make it even worse im uninstalling <emoji>
this game has a life season s <num> defaultss <num> tryhards and defaultss <num> defaults half tryhards end seasons <num> tryhardss <num> tryhards and meta guns s <num> ? in reality i just hope this game never exists and go normally life with other game now nobody touch or play other games and i hope s <num> is the last season ? cause this game cant live longer and thx for making and showing how this game grow from nobody knew to most popular game thank you epic realbuckedcave <num>
this game is money hungy it's a copy of pubg and the fanbase is toxic ! it's also unfair i will be level <num> and be put a level <num> they stole other people's dances and called them their own like best mates the og was by marlen weeb but what do they do ? they steal it as if it were their own !
i love this game but whenever me and my friend play and we are vs <num> more group we lag out the game or lag out and get killed and this isnt the first time i find it suspicious how this happens in the top <num> everytime and this has happened to friends also update : this game is a really good game devs always up to date slowly improving and i don't know why it has such bad ratings with a game that is very fun also dont complain its <num> free : )
the shotgun needs to be capped at <num> damage while point blank its mid rang damage needs to be reduced ! it makes no sense how a blue pump can do <num> damage from mid range !
dis game gave me de diabetes ! i dont like dat ! it has des trash skins and dey like be costing like <num> dollar ! i could get ur mum for an hour for dat ! anyway ! i hope u lik mah knowledge ! ill be dabing on ze haters <emoji> i have one of those litboi
pubg reigns superior this game is for children
i like the guns i dont like the glitch
it's one of the best things i've ever played it's given me something to do on xbox since destiny <num> is dead btw this is better than destiny <num>
im about to win but then it lags me off my teams building and i get shot by the enamy team
hopefully we would see playeruknown's battleground soon ! <emoji>
waiting in loading qeue for <num> min
this game has given me hours of fun and as a free game that's amazing it's good to have a game that all of my freinds can have easy access to and can play together feels like i'm back in hs when we use to all play games together more often with full cross platform i can finally play with all of my friends no matter what platform they are playing on thank you epic games !
although an unorigonal idea still much enjoyable your first win feels amazing btw <emoji> <emoji> ⚔⚔⚔⚔ <emoji> <emoji> ♻
frame drops in the beginning of every fight guns not balanced at all map is to small for <num> players and seems like gun fights are random if you win or not i will just hold out for pubg to drop
stupid game no wonder it is free
the battlepass was not worth it
was able to play one game of battle royal then i quit out to watch youtube then flash forward <num> hours and i launch the game then <num> windows pop up a were loading fortnite please wait then it says cant download uninstall something else then try again which is really frustrating as i have <num> gb free and the game itself has been installeddeleted many times as well as other stuff(gamesapps) but same experience every time fix this problem please
i have <num> words this game sucks
you can just jump around people with a shotgun and kill them pubg is the answer
theres no skill involved with this game you can spend <num> minutes looting then get sniped by someone who only has a shotgun even though you put put all your shots into them
this game is total dumpster fire ! do not waste your gigs on this sorry excuse for a game ! it <num> ripped off pubg with a sleazy building mechanic with resources the graphics are awful even for a cartoon styled game free to play doesn't matter to me they could pay me and i still would not download this you could find better battle royale games on a phone than this the map is way too small bullets go all over the place and the frame rate is dropping like tom brady drops balls please don't bother getting this piece of garbage game and save up for pubg you will thank me later
very epic indeed and lots of ⚔⚔⚔⚔ but it crashes sometimes <emoji>
if you are a major buy in you'll love this game personally it feels like you are nerfed otherwise i despise no i loathe this game
it says save the world will be free in <num> but it's not wtf
cant wait for this game it looks amazing
fortnite is the hottest game out but there are a few problems with this game for example pumps does <num> damage up close and they also should fix the lagging problem other than that this is a really good game <emoji>
f this game str <num> up game is wack
this game is so bad that is a ripoff of pubg one game i got tea baged this is a hateful game
this game is amazing and i really dont see any bugs the shotguns do less damage than they used to but that is good because u havee to work for a kill the only bad thing is how muchh vbucks cost which is for cosmetics so it is not pay to win
there is no way to learn to play if you are allowed to be killed as soon as you hit the ground how about giving time to find a weapon or creating a tutorial
the game keeps giving me an hour wait time before i get to play bullsht
you know that one dead bug in your screen door that you try to ignore thats fortnite
do not get this game it is pay to win and you will alway get instantly killed by someone with a shotgun or by a sniper you will never see
ill put it in <num> wordsphrases modders laggy trick people for money
hi my fortnite don't work
its a shooty game and its a good game to become a school shooter
bait n switch with paid loot early access is new marketing speak for paying to beta test wait for the actual release and save your money never again epic <emoji> holy crap what happened to the tower defense we paid for ?
love the fact that you can shoot threw wood how fun
all this game is is a big money grab it makes it free but makes it so that youll play it but makes it so that youll have to spend real money to get better things and this game is built on that along with that this game has no original ideas and relys heavly on mirotransactions to thee point where you will spend lost of mony on this
this game was so much fun when i first got it ! i even purchased the $ <num> version three days layer they appear tp have created a queue ! this was my go to game now i wont touch it <num> minute queue just to play is not okay ! i feel cheated at the highest level if they remedy this i eill rate <num> star sincerely destro
game is garbage guns are trash and shotguns are <num> inconsistent and the game is <num> luck based also players are rotten and bad sports
i love fortnite <emoji> ifeel like a pro player
this game is trash get pubg instead
i have been playing this for a pretty long time now and let me tell you this game is awesome ! <num> players last one standing wins ! even if you don't like the game it's free so you might as well try it i love that you are able to build in battles or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win i also like the storm slowly going over the map pushing in all the remaining players to one small area i also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find from rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge ! i also like the stuff that you can get loot from you can get loot from hot air balloons from the ground or you can get loot from golden chests ! i most of all love the extra modes that they add in my favorite is playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want ! what i don't really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get overall i think you should get it !
i used to hate this game a lot when it first came out but know i'm liking the game i'm happy i gave it a second chance i play this on pc it's better but xbox it's okay i have played three seasons <num> <num> and <num> and i have gotten better and it's really fun i love the changes that they made it make the game better and i do regret hating the game i would had the skull trooper and dark knight <num> being a great game
servers have <num> minute que at times just to log in and thats just the volume from only preorder players sometimes after the que login fails and restarts que from the beginning ! framrates drop hard at times almost as if the game freezes missions are recycled after playing <num> hours i've only come across <num> or <num> different mission types overhyped and unpolished which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game
with so many problems you still add to the game and ignore the problems that come with what you bring
i am not a fan i think its too much like pubg it also gets boring the only good part is the save the world and the cool loot lama
i don't like the fact you require xbox live to play on ps <num> you only require internet microsoft is trying to be greedy and make more money (not like they don't have billions)
this game is so friggin dope ! but just fix the clicheness and the fact i never find people because of that stupid double t tilted towers ! (also add a huge hikingbased mountain place called hikin' haywire)
im sick of this where everytime i land somewhere i get killed because of lagit's not okand i don't know how you guys do itbut every season is worse than the last one
garbage also it's extremely pay <num> win so if you're gonna play free don't bother
i don't even do reviews but they just obliterated pubg it's free now plays in <num> fps consistent updates and has a pve mode within the full game purchase i'm gladly giving this game <num> stars for how far they have come in a such short amount of time they fix bugs asap and actually deliver their product in a timely fashion my god i must say i am proud of you fortnite ! please keep up the good work these triple aaa companies need to learn from the little guys and actually deliver quality like this in reasonable quantities well done ! slow claps <emoji> download this and try it out you wont be disappointed with the latest update <num> <emoji>
it should not need xboxlive like ps <num>
i love this game <num> if you dont like it its cuz you cant aim or suck at building or your just trash ♻
they said we would be getting new content on a set date and then had to push it back cuz it was not ready well i already took the day off and canceled my other plans dont give us set dates unless you are <num> ready to do it on that date and when you lie to us reward us if ark lies to us they give double exp for a while and apologize i deal with the crashes at the last minute of a hour long mission and then when i get back in i get little or no rewards for the mission i deal with the pay as the only way to get good things p <num> w i do not like being lied to and then not rewarded we didnt force you to give us the date update jan so i paid <num> plus dollars for this game and now i am forced to wait <num> mins to log in queue because they let a whole bunch of pvpers have the game for free i am a paying customer i shouldn't have to wait in line with the people who got it free
this game is horrible ! you gave my son depression ! you crap load of s <emoji> it on my jimmy's screen ! i wasted my money for brain <emoji> washing game ! u have brought my child toshoot others and he says "lit" when he kills someone irl <emoji>
broken garbage words cant describe how this game broken tiered weapons rewarded for luck this game takes <num> skill building is dumb af this is a childspoor mans battle royale play pubg for a real game not this f <num> p greed fest of a game you want cool outfit have fun spending <num> $ on one outfit and another twenty for an axe lol you epic eat ur game the only reason people play this trash is because its free nobody would buy this trash ever ! also fortnite wasnt a br game at first now your team focuses <num> on br and said founders who supported this trash b <num> br epic ill never support another game you make ever
this is worse than infinite warfare do i have to say more !
such a bad game it gave me cancer
lags all the time bullets dont register such a cheap bs game
this game is fun but it could be better if i didn't go aginst teamers and try hard that will do anything to kill you if you could have people with epic accounts have skill matched players most of the time i have played with starters who get insta killed in the start an also some new items are just random another way ou could fix the game if you make playground have more players like <num> so people can practice also i have been in alot of games where people team but don't get banned also this game is a scam
this game is nothing but a poor attempt to copy pubg in a cartoonish fashion that needs to stop to give pu the rights to this type of game that means take this game off xbl and sue epic
no gameplay variety at all !
incredibly disappointed in the bofa in every match save your time and just play skyrim
pvp : rng bullets ruins pvp where do my bullets go ? pve : the lag is really bad at times you can tell epic games is putting their effort in pvp only we should call it paragon skilled base players stay clear
do not see the appeal of battle royal games all the cons of good games packed into one sht game better than pubg but thats not saying much maybe i just dont get it because i dont eat tide pods
the game has cheaters and bots don't play or you will lose money like me i lost <num> dollars i wanna to give to a friendly player but when i died to this bot player <num> i had <num> cent left i hate this gamei want my <num> dollars and my game fixed
from worst to insanely terrible to their getaway update they now have you getting rid of an item and make you grab the weapon instead of swapping most of the weapons still suck and the goddamn getaway mode ! it puts you in a smaller space and then you have to reach in the goddamn back of the goddamn van ! ladies and gentlemen this has been crowned as the worst and broken br game in history they should've stuck with the jackrabbit
this game is the best ! <emoji> but their are some mistakes but this game is very addicting
it a really good game and i recommend it but some thing just dont make sense like the hit boxes are out rages and i shoot someone so many time they dont die they shoot me like three time with a pistol and i die and when i jump they shoot under me and still does damage like ok and mostly every thing about it suuuuuck fixxxxx it the game is garbage pubg is better you game freaking sucks dude so i suggest you fix the game for the thousandth time
<emoji> supposed to be <num> star
how about you start charging for the game so you dont waste your time with your servers and spend more time making the game good
to prove it picture two people ne with a grey ar and one with a blue just installed who would win <num> of the time say something besides the blue ar your wrong
battle royale is just another lame pvp that only and i mean only rewards couch potatoes if you're lucky enough to have some intelligent squad mates you can still get jumped by someone who can snipe you with a shotgun from several blocks away (not kidding) the pve story mode is ok progression is slow but fun the crafting and leveling systems are likely to drive anyone up a wall they're so unnecessarily complicated (doubt they'll ever fix that either but oh well) if you have the patience pve is worth the money battle royale is not (and its free)
walk around a map for <num> minutes only to have the "strom" or someone camping in a corner kill you gameplay wise the aiming is awful guns are inaccurate loot system is completely messed i do not understand why this game is popular
once pubg comes to xbox one this game will die
you get to kill people and i dont like it you die
its okaybut pubg is better
fortnite is a very good battle royale game there's one thing i must point out however i had just noticed that the epic tactical shotgun has been removed please bring this gun back into fortnite : battle royale
they said that on <num> save the will be for free but its a lie
pubg players triggered cuz their game on xbox is complete trash nd fortnite is doing everything right pubg is dead hello fortnite <emoji>
you will almost spend more time updating than you will be playing because it is constantly needing updated ! now im almost out of data
fortnite used to be a good game ever since fortnite blew up epic got so greedy and started to focus on money and cosmetics over players they stopped caring about the players a long time ago and yet people still play it <num> and the whole lucktowin factor is just to get more appeal from trash players so that they'll play and buy items fortnite is just a moneygrab now
the game is just a remake of pubg just animated and obliderated every other good game in existance and all people talk about
purchased wont load since month <num> support wont help if needed ! calling for a refund today <num> smh i was so excited to play too
i like theres a thing were u make yur own base and thats it
pubg killed this game so it dumped this unplayable clone for free avoidwait for the real thing
don't waste your time on this game the weapons are so unbalanced that it either take <num> bullets to the chest kill one guy then <num> to the head to kill the next the amount of modders are insane i can't tell you how many times someone spawned a minigun out of nowhere as soon as we drop then destroy me if you want my advice go spend the $ <num> for pubg my friend has it and its so much better
the creators want money and nothing else
alice texas toast with peanut butter and chocolate milk please let me know if we have to work on my phone is it going today i am not in a good day i love that movie with you candy and chips please give me a phone
all u do is defend an atlas and this guys van its terrible and doesnt deserve <num> whatsoever
terrible lag and gun damage
everything about this game sucks
when i land in a desserted place i get killed from no where plus this game sucks and playerunknown's battleground is better
everyone is like talking a lot about this game everywhere and i can't wait to actually put my hands on such game and best of all it's free to play !
the aiming system is horrible
was bouta get a dub with my boi clerf he disconnected for no reason later the game building does not work at i died frick fortnite
i hate this game the game is play to win people who have the battle pass always win which gives them the upper advantage over other players the in game store is so expensive $ <num> for a player pickaxe and glider skin don't get it because its really horrible
i'm stoked ever since e <num> <num> showed gameplay
first off this games just hopping on the battle royale band wagon and second the games hitboxes are so random that you can't even hit someone in the chest with a rifle when they are <num> feet away edit : just replayed it for a while and it still sucks
it's a copy of pubg the map is like <num> times smaller than pubg
played for about <num> hours and i'm already bored missions are to easy zombie things wont hit you if you walk side to side and the constant freeze frame foor three seconds then coming back to getting hit is weak glad i only wasted <num> bucks not impressed at all
but i cant seem to figure out how this is supposed to be 'fun'
it's ok <emoji> i mean i won <num> times on this game yeah so i like this game
no incentives for winning microtransaction city for cosmetics play pubg unless your hard up for battle royal with rng aiming
well the game lags too much the hitbox are broken the range of weapons and their spread are also broken i died so many times to hackers with wall speed and aimbot hacks my advice ? wait until pubg gets released on the xbox one this year don't play this overhype garbage
second updatestill cant log in after <num> weeks of owning nor can the servers access my purchased content i cant believe i paid for ths game stay away ! ive had this game since launch and this is the second time i havent been able to play a game that i paid a lot of money for ! this is not good seems like their servers are constantly down it wont log me into my epic account despite the fact ive already played this game a few times this is garbage
this is battle front <num> on steriods and its way trashier
save the world is good but the battle royale is a waste of money and time
edit : harry <num> x <num> & its other bf supreme gmb got triggered by my comment lmfao dude <emoji> proves my point all the more that this game just another pos that will be dead soon cause they over hype the crap out of it its just a quick buck for em like overwatch one thing dose alright everyones gotta make their ow n verson pretty much like that "can i copy your homework" meme fortnite : "can i copy your homework ? " h <num> z <num> pubg ect "yeah just change it so it doesn't look like you copied" free & still dead meme
thats all there is to be said
this game was designed for brads and chads
