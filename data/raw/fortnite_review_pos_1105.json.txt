<num> damage with shot gun point blank <num> times this game blows
the tutorial is long begining map sector is too easy to the point where you dont even need to build defences if you make it past the first few hours i think its fun but could get old pretty fast recommend playing with friends blast through the beginning and it gets more challenging btw this game will be free next year if you don't want to risk buying it
weapons are extremely unbalanced hit registration is non existant half of the time and spontaneous death occurs way yoo often from a single bullet from anything not to mention the weapon accuracy seems to be luck based
take the cartoony monsters of pvz add in the epic weapons and feel of borderlands and throw in the crafting open world feel of <num> days ; and you get this action packed thrill of a game !
the longer you play the more the game introduces making it harder and more complicated i've played the game for the better part of today ( <num> ) and i will say that so far i have been enjoying it thoroughly even being stuck playing with random strangers and no communication it's easy enough that you don't necessarily need communication although believe me it helps the further you progress the more types of baddies the game introduces and the harder and stronger they become the skill tree becomes increasingly larger and slightly more confusing the more you level up and i will say the thing i have been annoyed with the most is the lack of clear description or explanation for a lot of game mechanics specifically having to do with survivors squads and other such things you deal with in the menus but to be fair some things i've given up in confusion on get explained just a few story missions later has a great feature that allows to rejoin ongoing game if your game crashes
the game is great the crafting is easy the combat isnt hard to figure out and theres alot of weapons and character the graphics are great and overal a great game
i love the look and the borderlands feel i think they should add split screen though overall its awesome also its only <num> dollar for the regular edition !
i would give it a <num> but i bought alot of vbucks but dont have cross platform also xbox should get free skins and picaxes and please fix double pump if you do i will love it
cant put controller down this game is totally awesome addicting and challenging !
havnt been this excited for a game in a while !
its fun but it had a specel feel when i started during christmas but it lost it whith season <num> and the glitches also building used tobe simpler so ya
this is fun but expensive they should drop the price to half of what it is now
you can't even play the game without running into a tryhard who no lifes the game everyday <num> hours a day my friends use to play different games and talk about actual stuff now it's just "i need to get a new cosmetic before my mom grounds me for getting v bucks with her debit card" people non stop play this game to the point where the game isn't fun anymore they still play it thought to show they can win the only real objective is to win and get cosmetics i mean the lag is horrible there are sweaty people left and right the game is pretty much pointless and it is taking away the chance to do other things now it's just fortnite this is what this generation has come to just warning you if you get sucked in by this game you're not getting out save the world is ok but everything else sucks
so you want to buyplay a good battle royale game ? well this is not the game for you "welcome to fortnite battle royale a game such like pubg we might be getting sued for it we have <num> of a kind weapons like the pumpshotgun it has <num> damage per shot but it only does <num> close range we have the brecciwait i mean the semiauto shotgun its supposed to do less damage than the pump but lets just say with this weapon who needs a sniper that brings us to the snipers specifically the semi and the bolt each bullet you shoot has a faster drop rate than your prom dates the theres the rifles the burst and the full auto each one is terrible in its own way the burst has the spray of a pornstar and the full auto hits like a pea shooter then the submachine gun oh and its direct retarded cousin the tacticle version both are just god awful like god wouldn't use these to kill people he'd use the revolver which has the best accuracy so in general just wait for pubg not this"
love the game but there are still many issues in need of tlc first playing with friends is a joke if you are <num> level difference forget about being social to progress through the levels after the initial <num> hours play time requires either money spent on "vbucks" or a lot of in game time not suprising since this game will be free to play in the near future but still frustrating ( <num> hours for one tech node at level <num> [obviously i'm not their yet but i did the math]) all that being saidgreat game
it is surely a game that will keep you interested throughout the time you play always keeping you on your toes with thoughts of where you will get shot at from next it is definitely a game that is worth a shot ! <num> !
update : the game is getting better give it a try if you're interested ! still has a long way to go though <emoji>
fortnite is a very enjoyable experience with friends your mileage may very depending on which version of the game you get and how much time your willing to put in it but the game has a terrible repetition factor that for people who want a variety of things to do in the game will be disappointed greatly like i was for those who are ok with this extreme repetition the games systems gameplay and over all structure is great (ha puns)
founders get nothing but random loot crates it takes far too long to progress have a favorite class from the trailer ? be ready to grind for hours and hours before playing it find a cool gun ? be ready to grind to craft it enjoying your loot ? be ready to grind when it breaks no reason to pay $ <num> for a f <num> p grind
i had issues but the game is awesome now
i enjoy game with the little amount of friends i have
the game is fun at first but if you even get the slightest hint of competition you'll only get mad at the game meaning it'll turn into a game you think you're having fun at but are really putting yourself in hours of repeated pain
i enjoy it increasing in difficulty mission variety a genuine learning curve compared to a lot of games joining others and seeing their designs have made me always want to use a few ideas the leveling is extensive and loot seems fair even for those getting the $ <num> version despite slightsmall server issues it's still enjoyable filled with bits of frustration
this game is horrible it is just a game full of trolls and confusion never be friends with people who friends unless you know them !
fornite is falling apart the game use to be fun now its boring and stale shotguns are useless because smgs are op plus the game is nerfing the thing that makes it unique and that is building along with countless bugs and lags epic fix your game
everytime i try to play it it just crashes it doesn't even start
save the world give itinsted of giving us ne guns in battle royal give us save the world for free plz !
its too fast and raided by <num> year olds

it keeps saying that there was an error signing in to xbox live is there anything i can do to fix it ? it's been like this for months update : i try to sign in n your website but it says that my account is inactive i tried signing in with a different account but then it says my xbox live account was already linked please tell me how to reactivate my account once you fix this i will give a <num> star rating until then you are stuck with <num> star please fix it
most inconsistent gun fights i've ever seen in a game ! sometimes shotguns do <num> damage a shot and sometimes they do literally less than <num> tactical shotguns do an average of <num> dmg wtf ? rifles can take <num> shots to kill ? subs take <num> shots ? rockets do less damage than a pump shotty headshot ? the cosmetics are awesome but i can't have fun playing a game with the worst gunfights than any game i've ever seen they focus on adding stuff to their game rather than balancing the game they already have for a third person shooter this game is embarrassingly bad make shotguns do hard damage not variety ars are painfully inaccurate i could rant about the cons of this game for hours whereas i can finish listing the pros in <num> minutes epic games i think i speak on behalf of your most disgruntled fans balance your gun fights this is just infuriating to watch and play <num> almost unplayable
this was a great game till they broke it time and time again servers go down almost every week lazy devs and clearly board as well to let this petty shit happen the next cockstar in the making fix you epic
the vbucks\coins you have to buy with real money which sucks they should make it so that every level you get like <num> <num> coins its such a stressful game aswell atleast make a coin system maybe like every win is <num> vbucks and every kill is <num> vbuck that would make the game alot more enjoyable then it is right now
sorry i'll keep my soul
the game starts out fun with loads of characters skills weapons and the ability to build your own bases problem being that after about mission <num> you realize that you're going to be playing the same few missions over and over again to make small gains for loads of work which you'll want to bring friends with to play with you as every mission is incredibly boring but both of those qualities are a little more forgivable on a free to play model in addition as with every early access game it's really buggy and sometimes the connection becomes so unstable that it is unplayable this game is also bogged down by the f <num> p model of paying to progress and having good gear and equipment hidden behind loot boxes so the tl ; dr wait until it's free to play as the game is built as a free to play with all of the annoyances of that model in the paid version
this game is fun and a grind but mostly it's a buggy laggy glitchy mess not to mention they reset our "permanent" bases today without warning wait for free to play
it's all about if you drop in and get the pump at the startor else youll get blasted by it bc no gun not even the scar can beat it within <num> m onestly i've given up on the hope for them ever maaking this game fair bc it keeps getting worse
ive got an extra standard edition if someone wants it
while the game combines several familiar and common elements from so many games epic games has pull it off in a way that makes this game truely feel and play like an innovative oneofakind orginal ! on the fence i initially spent a few hours reading early alpha reviews and other posts prior to buying the limited edition founders pack ; afterwards i can say with the bonus loot and game keys for friends it was money well spent ! my friends and i are now having a blast after rotating on and off of so many other games this game really offers something for everyone and has it all ! the building customization heroschematicfollower leveling system along with an incredibly diverse and detailed researchskill tree system will undoubtly provide years of fantastic game play in addition the daily login rewards are very generous and actually provide useful items you might think the missions may get repetitious ; but the crafting and progression keep you coming back for more ! ~ enjoy !
please add split screen for multiplayer !
fortnite takes a lot of popular mechanics and makes a game out of them zombies ? check horde mode ? check lots of loot ? check crafting and base building ? check tower defense ? check rpg style skills trees ? double check it's not short lf it's flaws however game crashes more often than i would like i can see the missions getting repetative and there is a slight lean towards pay to win but if you enjoy grinding for loot and buildingdefending bases than this is the game for you
tthis game was worth the wait hell my friend got me this and game sharing wit my gf we are having a blast even if its not fully open world this a builders
you can build whatever you like
got the game going ehh ok lets try it <num> hours later im still playing takes shoot and loot and mixes in base deffence wich is actualy very awsome just took me a sec to get used to but in the end its great <num> $ is well well worth it im doubt ill be putting this game down for a week straight <num> addicting
i see people saying this is "pay to win" but that is just flat out liedelusion they tell themselves so they can hate on itthis is the first game in a long time that lets you earn premium game money ingame you dont have to buy it with real money ! if thats your argument for why this game sucks i feel sorry for you cuz you are gonna miss out on all the awesomeness that is fortnite ! (also dont complain that its in beta cuz everyone who has been waiting for this game knew that coming in its not epic games fault you dont do your research) this game starts out slow cuz it wants to ease you into itafter about <num> or so missions the game opens up and gives you more freedomif you stopped after a few missions thinking that was all the game was you are <num> wrong (you eventually have free reign over your personal base but in the beginning you must do what they want you to) lastly i have no problems joining with people soooooi hope this clears everything up !
i enjoy the game because its a break from traditional shooters looking for realistic gameplay i believe with an optional competitive mode this game could create a lasting name for it self dont listen to the pubg hate both are good games
one of the most fun games i've ever played wonderful community for example i needed some coal to finish a gun and its very hard for me to find and some guy just gave me some also i love the fact that you can pay the difference and upgrade to the more expensive versions without buying the game again
just add the refund system back maybe allow <num> use only
you guys didnt put lot of effort in thiss people arehacking and you guys arent doin anything about it and need to make updates twice a week
i don't like how i hit the guy with <num> bullets and he killed me
i don't understand how this game is popular i would rather rail my great grandfather with my cock than play this
its just like comparing marvel vs dc halo vs cod apple vs samsung dont compare the amount of similarities judge the game by itself then compare the quality of the game with another knowing that making different battle royal type games is hard to accomplish fortnite did make different mechanics and resulting playstyles the quality of these mechanics are not the best but i prefer fortnites playstyle compared to pubg
building mechanic is awesome ! simple flexible and fun you can use it to build forts before the wave comes or like a defensive weapon in the heat of combat the part of the game not in the videos is a deep mathcard collection game like a rpg with <num> unique character models so far firstperson perspective option (wo weapon animation) and large level areas with very welldone procedural generation downside ? needs a toggle for firstperson this game is an awesome snazzy zombie survival version of star trek online's mathcard game
an absolute visual representation of cancer <num> should be removed from space and time <emoji>
inconsistent damage trash building trash gameplay for as many updates this game gets its still worse than pubg
i love the gameplay but <num> its laggy and <num> theres major problems with installing and uinstalling save the world i accidentally uinstalled save the world and so i tried to install it back but my luck it just kept saying instllization stopping and it stopped at <num> and wouldent go up so i reset my xbox and i canceled my que but when i looked at my games fortnite wasant there so i went to my install tab and it said the whole game wasant installed to sum it if you try to installsave the world and u cancel que cause it dosent work it uinstalls the whole game :
i did played fortnite but oh boy this game make me dying easy myself because i never played battle player unknown and of course fortnite not interested this game <emoji>
this game breaks every week they don't care about fixing this game for console it's been over a month since building broke and they've done nothing don't worry though this game on pc got fixed right away
i would pay $ <num> for this for the current pvp vehicles and a biggerenlarged map would be sweet in the future but this is still in beta state the devs said bigger maps are coming and they are working on a way for vehicles to fit in download this game ignore all the bad reviews if bugs are out they are quick to fix <num> quick updates in the past couple days and now it's running smoother than butter
make save the world free
this game is really just an awesome game only one thing split screen there needs to be a local co op then <num> star
like pubg but you know its free
just wondering when my velvet couch is going to arrive i ordered it off this site about <num> weeks ago and yet nothing has shownup at my door the problem is that i plan on giving it to my uncle who is in an iron lung but his anorexic son keeps rubbing my virgin olive oil all over my current furnishings if this doesnt arrive by next week my downs lesbian daughter (aka slave) will get her peyton mannings rubbed by a jew who supports nazi germany much love leprosy boiz (ps where my hitler at doe ? )
on my xbox one it is awesome but when i searched "fortnite battle royale" on my computer in the microsoft store it said "you owe this app" and i went to start i did not see it do you think you can help ?
dude the lags are killing the game
i sold my wife and daughter for wifi and vbucks best game ever ps gave every one thats come to my house ligma also if you think you can clap my cheeks you better sleep with one eye open
secretly they use bloom for a gun fights which means it is more luck based not skill based
im so tired of this game <num> percent is luck base you took it from pubg it lags and gliches i like the style but fix it please
is too random and is a pubg copy about <num> of the game is action most of it is loading and walking lol
like : the fact that i'm still alive dislike : the fact i played it
the title says it all then they dont get updates out when said about an hour ? naw more like <num> ill just stick to a good game like pubg while im at it ill stick on a better system as well which is my pc garbage
they market the game as though its a complete game but really all you are paying for is access to the beta of a game that will eventually be f <num> p other than that the game is heavily grindingmicrotransaction based the gameplay takes place in missions rather than the open world one would expect from this genre of game meaning nearly everything you make each mission is gone upon completion
calamity has fat and
great ed movie love strong kkk presense with blacks totured <emoji> my migos are including mowing lawns teacheskids that women cant vote good vorempreg to this every night with my paided for wifes of the <num> and a half <num>
this game is bs because of you all damn sweaty tryhards get good at the game you garbage players also fix pump dropoff i'm also an og player ( been playing since season <num> )
looks like a turtle took a and shoved it in a vagina
its alright game but it gets boring you jump out you either die or get stuff and then wander for <num> minutes only to die or get hot from all sides here come the git gud people but i dont want to try to get better if i have to go through that every game
the game's shooting mechanics take no skill as the shotgun is so inconsistent and ar bullets don't go where they are supposed to go the only decent part about this game that takes some skill is sniping the game also takes so long to switch and equip weapons and the servers kick you out for no reason this game needs to be fixed by ''epic games'' until then i will never admit it to being even a ''decent'' game <emoji>
dis dun killed my
this game is crap you will be in the last minute of whatever you are doing and it just freezes and boots you loved the game when it first came out then they did crap updates and fixed nothing dont buy wait till its free for a freeze game !
the game is awesome but crashes way too much when taking your squad into a mission and right after you complete one it's done it to me <num> times today <emoji> another thing that needs improvement is the inventory space instead of having stacked items that are limited to <num> it should be increased to a <num> or <num> and some epic and legendary weapons break a little to easily so if some mechanic could be put in place for that it would be good overall this game is good just needs a few tweaks here and there
horrible lag on decent connection unplayable no issues with other games
any fan of crafting building and defense games would love this ! would definetly recommend this game ! looks great and plays very well ! two thumbs up <emoji> and a <num> star rating well deserved for a great fun title like this one ! am really enjoying the game definetly worth paying $ <num> for <emoji> does not disappoint
the game requires no skill you literally just point at who you want to kill and boom theyre dead look out for those kids who spam walls everywhere because theyre too scared for a gun fight my <num> year old cousin has won solo many times because he only knows the two buttons to win this game the aim button and the shoot button atleast pubg requires skill and patience its fair in every gun fight and people actually have to fight for their lives this game ? no you just have to tear down a bunch of houses and get a scar and boom instant win leave this game for little kids shoukd really put a maximum age limit of <num> on the game
you just do the same thing over and over again it would be good to make a sandbox mode without the objectives
i love this game very fun and most importantly very free <emoji>
unlike <num> of the reviews here i am going to try to give an actual review pvp is fun with friends but can be frustrating at times (but what games arn't ? ) there are some problems like odd hit detection and a very steep learning curve for a free to play game however (or partly free anyway) this is incredibly good i love the style of the game as well most games in this genre all want to be realistic but this one takes a chaotic cartoony approach that feels and plays very differently then the other games in the genre (for reference i have played h <num> z <num> and pubg) if you want a realistic experience then this is not the game for you otherwise i would recommend trying it out at least personally i enjoy the alternate game modes best like <num> v <num> i recommend playing with friends as playing alone can be boring at times oh and did i mention cross play ? i often play this game on pc with friends on xbox or mobile you can't play with psn players sadly
i lovee this game but i wish save the world was free <emoji>
super fun battle royale mode but they need to add a killcam or at least a variation of a killcam because sometimes when i die i want to see how they did it
make a <num> v <num>
ok i've seen so many <num> star reviews that are poorly made and barely given out any reasons why they dislike this game if they dislike fortnite then fine i don't blame them it's their opinion but like always plz don't judge a game because of the communityfandom that will lead toxic hatedoms to appear but without that being said let's talk about the things what i like and dislike about fortnite the pros : the building mechanic the art style the iconic emotes the item store (at least it's not p <num> w) the outfitscharacter customization system the gunplay and killing someone and collecting there loot the cons : the gameplay is shallow it's unbalanced the annoying shotguns sometimes there's glitches and it's repetitive (overall) fortnite : battle royale could've been great but it's not i am glad that its popular but it's a little disappointing but it isn't bad (final verdict) <num> needs some work (edit : so i've played save the world mode and it's very good)
this is not a finished game it is paid early access it should be listed in the game preview program yet both microsoft and epic are more than willing to lie to you about what your buying save your money for it's free to play launch next year !
this game is awsome it has good graphic the only thing is tha instead of adding new weapons they should fix the old ones
it would be better if they did more but thats impossible because tons of youtubers are playing this game and not talking about any of the problems
its great if you just wanna chill out and pass time
by all means the game is great but the fact that i used $ <num> on the game makes me dissatisfied and disappointed <emoji> because the game is gonna be free if i knew that i would of waited for the game <emoji>
waited <num> min in queue just so it could fail on me over & over not bad enough there are many ppl having to wait <num> min and still cant logg in i wish i could give this <num> stars i regret ever having heard of this game dont believe the hype i want my money back !
if you really think about it there is a whole lot of other games out there that deserves recognition and should have a massive multiplayer community but this is what really i see everywhere ? i know thats because its a trend everybody i know irl or through xbox grinds this including me but in reality its not even that fun i just wish this game will die sooner than later (please) i have been playing this non stop since season <num> stealing ws but dont get a free skin just emotes and a free lolipop axe so far smh
i love the game but ever since the newest update that disabled shopping carts whenever i go to the area around the bridge near flush and flush the game freezes and shuts down please fix soon
epic pls tell your comunetie that no skins have a life
yd yall make a ps <num> skin but still aint made a xbox skin <emoji>
in the beginning this was a fun and entertaining game but now it seems like a social standard like as if your not good enough at fortnite your not cool or popular it’s really just overhyped and once you get it even if you don’t like it you feel as if you need to buy the battlepass and all the other things just to fit in good thing i put this game down real fast !
this game is a laggy broken mess fix it and if anyone is even thinking about playing this dont
this game is fun but it is trash ! and dont go saying well your just bad cause thats not why ! i was in a <num> v <num> and i pulled out my pump and it was invisible ! which meant i couldnt shoot it ! im giving it <num> stars because this bug has been in the game for so long and they still havent fixed it ! instead they focus on more important things like squinty eyed in the loading screen background
i purchased this game twice once on xbox and once on pc i signed into my epic games account on booth but was unable to play on pc i contacted support got on their forums posted multiple times <num> emails so far first they ignored me then they started sending me excuses instead of making it right the excuse you have to make a new account that is not linked to xbox in order to play fine i can do that but wait you still can't play because it was purchased on another account ok so give be a code for a new copy that i can play nope more excuses and saying i have to buy it a third time they keep blaming xbox instead of making it right horrible support and bad business ethics
had this happens while playing missions white delivering the bomb and you can't actually find objectives because there not on the map we literally destroyed everything on the map and then the game removed us because we ran out of time because the objective where nowhere to be found
dont buy this terrible game this game is boring and i do not recommend it to anyone
with the game still in beta $ <num> is the only buy the game is fun but over hyped also the more i played the game the more i enjoyed it the game has some good qualitys like a huge skill tree and depth in squads an character building an actual building at the same time feels like it was all wasted when you get into the game itself the quest rotate every few hrs or so same quest just different locations they throw in daily challenges trials to help but are still played on these same maps its not till levels <num> when you first see new locations in the game they do add a few new enemies as you progress just with all that depht the gameplay itself falls short filled with repetition an a lot of grinding with drops that you don't need an looking for the ones u do need for crafting you basically replay the same maps over & over again just rotated the campaign is just that with breaks of objectives that need to be done on these same maps just rotated locations an mixed in
this is the worst battle royale game i ever played first reason is highly overrated not gonna say any names second reason the game is pay to look ugly and the skins are ridiculously prices and battle pass is not needed and last not certainly least the worst ripoff of pubg and minecraft both of these game are fun but not fortnite that's all i have to say if you read this rant do you agree ? also i prefer despacito for life then this mistake
terrible not fun a laggy mess ! no fun shotguns nerfed too much ; zero damage pointblank ranged ; just not fun no more games ruined season <num> c <num> too op ! fix or i quit
garbage game with awful mechanics the whole game is spamming structures and hoping your guns hit the target battle royal needs to die already maybe try an actual skilled base game and not free trash games this game gets way to much credit for absolutely nothing any game company that makes cash off of micro transactions is retarded epic why did you give upp gears for this trash !
do you watch rick and morty ? if so this game is not for you this game is directed for the high school sports ball players ie the intellectually challenged battle royale mode is clearly plagiarised from pubg's avantgarde game designs which gets its inspiration from gambling statistically the odds of winning a game of battle royale is the same as getting a doctorate from harvard a more prestigious and respectable achievement the cartoony art style displays its immature appeal furthermore the character designs show off how well epic games can objectify women a pure luckbased experience to cash out on the battle royale craze the save the world story mode features unimaginative situations it started out with an interesting premise a mysterious outbreak has taken over the world and you team up with a crew of wacky robots to drive them back and then nothing happens you're running the same missions ad nauseam and landscapes are all the same with no sense of progression
here is a rundown of he typical fortnite game you first chose whether you want to have fun or get a victory royal (play aggressive or passive) and then get over the fact that <num> of the playerbase will make hackusations if you win with a default character on another note the useless microtransactions are strong in this game im sure we've all learned by now that cosmetics = skill right ? anyway after effortessly clearing the drop area its only a matter of time untill someone snipes you from halfway aross the circle and you sit there wondering why this game is so popular or die as soon as you land thinking the same damn thing and winning is just boring you sit in the circle and waitforeveruntill there are <num> people in a space ⅓ the size of an american football field and pick them off with some random legendary weapon all in all fortnite isn't terrible just mediocre dont waste any of your <num> tb worth of space on it
this game went downhill with all these updates they try to fix things that aren't even broken but leave bugs unfixed and they keep adding pointless weapons each week why don't they just add <num> with <num> update ?
how am i supposed to play if i'm constantly rubberbanding and lagging all over the place ? this game is alright save the world's hombase storm defense blows i can atleast get in top <num> and then die from a guy camping in a housei literally tryhard but this game apparently all luck and a little skill so i lose in the most bs ways
honestly game was fun earlier but this game has so many bugs and they dont even fix them now its the worst game i've ever played
the gameplay is fine i just do not like the obnoxious people that ruin fortnite itself <num> stars for the game <num> star for the players
the devolopers are steadilly working on making the game hard rather generating any sort of content after playing stonewood nothing changes except for higher lvl enemies this is a pay to win game do not buy it ! <emoji>
i originally rated this ☀☀ but decided to change it after the respect for the developers epic games are absolutely amazing at conveying patch notes accountability and showing their sense of urgency this game has only got better and better it doesn't compare to pubg and that is the point all of the dummies saying they copied pubg are nieve the same could be said for any title does that mean there can only be <num> shooter <num> racing game(do not buy project cars <num> ) etc ? of course not ! gather a friend and play duos or grab up to <num> and play squad the game gets better and better as you do
ps <num> and xb <num> can now cross play
why can't we earn coins if we win a match or get to a certain level ? that'd give people a reason to play more
out of <num> games some bug limits gameplay (invisible guns not able to pick anything up some areas not even allowing me in etc) in <num> of them the other one booted me off for no reason at all edit : the game is somewhat fixed but still trash every game in every region is so boring because everyone lands at tryhard towers even ones you do meet desperately build at any range thinking they look good when in reality they can't get a single kill weapon balancing you kidding me ? a full clip of a blue pistol won't kill but one shot of a gray tac does one last : items $ <num> for a cosmetic skin ? that's robbery overrated garbage pass on this one
(let me just point out this is my first review for a video game)i feel like everyone's hating this well made game (in my opinion anyway)part of it you'll notice alot of these reviews are written by alot of younger people and some also don't make any senseothers say it's too hardand others just don't like it which is completely finebut that's what i think is half of itok enough of that let's get on with the reviewi'll start out with the only flaw in my opinion it can lag alot it could be my internet thoughi had a time when i was in the top <num> (or something like that)and i got teleported to my roof of my base and died <emoji> some complain about vbucks being too expensive(which buy emojis dance moves skins etc) but grant no competitive advantageso it really is a free gamei'm running out of letters so i got to short this upon with the good stuff <num> no pay to win game <num> fun to play <num> its sweet to play against <num> playersbut only one winnerthanks for reading my opinion <emoji> ✌
payed for stw not br yet br gets all the attention
i used to play the game till i realised how toxic a community of <num> year olds can be basically voice chat is ''double pump ! '' also ''hes hacking ! '' and ''your trash ! '' and dont get me started on the streamers cough cough ninja who do stupid things like the ''pompom'' what is a pom pom then lastly how they ruined there game by adding things like golfcarts and grocery carts
i hate the lag because it's getting me killed

pvp battle royale mode : i've noticed some people complaining about fortnight's br vs pubg's br and i wanted to explain a few points <num> fortnight's br is far better at this point at fixing problems and bringing updates out while pubg has a harder time at it <num> fortnights br is focused on building mechanics while pubg is more focused on vehicles meaning more drive by shootings <num> fortnights br has a smaller map and because of that you get more action while pubg has a larger map meaning less action <num> fortnights br although cartoony has better graphics in the long haul then pubgs more realistic style <num> fortnights br gliders are more fun and useful then pubgs not so well done parachutes <num> fortnights br weapons are simple pick up and shoot weapons while pubgs weapons are reasonably complex with lots of different attachments and fire rate modes <num> fortnight br is free while pubg costs $ <num> both are fun just depends on your play style
loot requires microtransactions <num> skill trees = unnecessarily complex systems detract from core gameplay which is fun but underdeveloped all "quests" are essentially the same
its fun with friends but epic needs to stop adding and start fixing
as time passed i learned cosmetics don't help you win i don't have skins but i have <num> wins total i think we need servers for different skill levels and vbucks based on placement and kills if you had wins before it would be added to your account thank you epic <emoji>
nonstop lag throughout matches and poor gunplay and combat make this an incredibly frustrating experience you spend the entire match looting and running all over the place to die upon your first encounter due to unbalanced weaponry when you spend <num> or more minutes gathering items and building loot to only be oneshot by someone with the strongest weapon in the game it really makes the whole point and time you spent in the game a waste to not even be able to get one shot off really makes the game pointless to play why spend a half an hour to not even be able to fire your gun once as the enemy with the best weaponry in the game to oneshot you ? this game is a literal waste of your time
my pastor told me to delete it or satan will enter my body
i dont like how you have to pay just to be not called a noob ! also just for a free game it has terrible transaction even though the company needs moneythe gameplay might be fun but its concept is repeated in a wayalso the rng system is kind of balancedbut just for this dumb game my feed is filled with fortnite freaks looking for a team i know the company cant control that thoughin conclusion this is way too popular of a game just for repeated gameplaybut at least its decent
slowly making the game worse with every update
epic games moar liek bepis games there are not enough deagles good way to keep your virginity
obviously for poor white people and virgins
fortnite sucks it is trash heck i agree it stinks hope this game dies it just suck
this game is decent fun and addicting pve and pvp are great you don't need to spend money to progress and to the people whining about its price as a game when its released for free you get your money refunded so chill out
the only thing i hate is the dmg system either make it more realistic or keep the dmg equal for the gun you use very annoying where you shoot someone with a close shotgun <num> times and they don't die while they shoot you once with rifle and you die
pros : simple quick matches building and those spicy astetics cons : weapon grades needs more traps it also needs to expand areas and it needs to fix hit registration fyi : to all who say fortnite copied pubg i just want you to know pubg copied h <num> z <num> so now you know shut up with that nonsense opinion : overall the game is fun and free so why not give it a try it has it's issues just like any other game but if you compare it to pubg they both have similar issues except fortnite is free pubg is $ <num>
i really love this game but it needs to be available on pc !
it is nice but we should not have to pay for gold to play this game
trying to milk money from little kids only provides to casual fanbase not the competitive fans recommend if yyou are under <num> <emoji> but if you are above that age i dont recommend
game deserves a low rating its very overrated most of the positive reviews are by little kids who havent even started puberty and blindly support a mediocre game its only popular because it is free the people who dislike the game get attacked by these who think fortnite is the only game on the planet and immediately assume you are either bad or play pubg its annoying ! worst of all other games add br because they are begging for more players thats how fortnite became popular epic needed to save fortnite because not many people liked "save the world" so epic decided to sap off of pubg's success with br but this time making it free and advertising it to younger people thats how fortnite br became popular those younger people mindlessly defend fortnite with arguments like "you just havent gotten a win" or "you are just a salty pubg fan" or even " you you suck i hate you fortnite is the best game ever go kys" i might get bombarded with angry messages for this
very disappointed ! they removed the jiggles from the calamite's hoocas (brest) now my peepee doesn't get hard now now i have to go on po hub to watch minecraft lets plays
pretty fun but gets tiring after no that long very repititive even with weekly changes
you wanna play the most bestest game ever play this
its a really good gamemode and if u dnt have money for pubg boom battle royale
this game sux all the little kids get horny for it <num> would not beat my meat over
i love this game on my xbox but why isn't it available on the pc ? i just wanna know
these are my favorite types of games if you are into shooter freeroam games this is for you
this game used to be so great now it's a piece of crap the shotguns are beyond broken the damage will go from <num> to <num> in the end you'll just get killed by a submachine gun when you get a good shot off with your shotgun they nerfed building nerfed shotguns and buffed smgs epic is trash and refuses to listen to any of their community we all want good and balanced gameplay and epic decides to add in "thanking the bus driver" fortnite was in its prime in season <num> from then on it has strayed further and further from what it was epic just needs to fix their game they finally did something right and then they screwed it up
been waiting for this forever <emoji>
this is a great way to test skill and overall fun but there are some bugs that ruin the game like how sometimes i switch over one slot with a gun and it throws me on the wrong slot with bandages nd gets me killed please fix this
first off i did not hate this game entirety just that you know just dropped the base game into apit of fire
buying any version of this does not at this time mean you will be able to play many who have bought physical and digital copies are locked out of their accounts and are told to rebuy what they have already purchased codes that are included in physical copies are not properly redeeming myself aswell as many others havnt been able to play for <num> days buyers beware ! i would post this review on the version i purchased but it doesnt reconize that i own it game support takes <num> hrs to respond and has been no help
this game is trash it is a rip off for pubgit's art is bad the controls are ok but you can't o in first personthose are the major complaintsemotes are boring except for a few new modes show the brokeness of the game because of balance issues for the people that get the event item i cannot recommend i want to try to give it a chance but i just can't if they fix these i would give it a chance but only if they fix themlag is also bad my friend lost games because of it
this shouldn't be a game
man i love player unknowns battle gr i mean fortnite !
i loved this game until season <num> before it was a great game and was fun but now it is full of <num> year olds who call you a noob if you don't have a $ <num> skin now all my friends play fortnite and i am the only one who hates it
in a large bowl sift together the flour baking powder salt and sugar make a well in the center and pour in the milk egg and melted butter ; mix until smooth heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle using approximately <num> cup for each pancake game isn't worth talking about heres a pancake recipe
i had thoughts of commiting pubg before i got this spectacular game but then i realized life is worth living after playing a couple rounds the graphics are so realistic and the way the game has complete noobs going up against pros is so fair and balanced i also love the variety all <num> of this game's maps are breathtaking i have spent <num> dollars on this masterpiece but have yet to place in the top <num> i have spent so much time and money on this art that i have been evicted from my apartment i am writing this review from the welfare line i accidentally ate all <num> of my children because i thought they were chicken nuggets and this game helped me through those tough times my wife left me because of my love for this game and i got a roblox girlfriend the next day thank you fortnite for saving my life !
fix ur game u
this game has the worse deaths than mw <num> you can put a whole clip into someone with them not taking damage and they can <num> shot you im not kidding one of the worst games ive ever played
anywhere you go there's campers
this stupid game ruins friendships all my friends only play this stupi game and when they say they'll play they just keep playing forever and never do anything else this game is stupid
its a good game but i hate that you have to pay for skins how about unlocking skins or skins in pve who agrees ?
it made my pee pee hard
this is the fifth time writing this so its going to be breif now this isn't written to hate on the game this is actually one of my favorite games im writing this in hope epic games will see it the grid system is really messed up if im trying to build a wall i don't want it to be place in the groud or below whatever im standing on also the lag i don't know if its the game or my internet but everyones complaining about it so i assume its the game please fix it if possible that all the issues i have with the game another thing please read comments not ratings when seeing if something is worth getting ive seen people ive the game a one star because there were to many tryhards its pathetic seeing how salty people have caused an amazing game to have a two star rating overall
it is a watered down version of pubg
the game is fun and thrilling <emoji> plus it's free !
i can't win little kids <num> gud
bring back the irst theme song
it is fun and not too challenging for the normal missions however the storm sheild missions are nearly impossible alone and it is a real grind to get the materials needed for defenses defenders and bullets it just really needs solo balance but besides that it is a great game
"heads up review of br only" i've seen lots of <num> star reviews for stupid reasons and <num> star reviews for just as pissy reasons so here we go ! cons to pros ! cons' toxic and childish fanbase bad balancing v <num> rgin bucks requires real money to many old glitches its ez to get in a match with tryhards or kid noobs pros ok weapons cool unlockables nice map not p <num> w overall fortnite is just bad the cons are bad and nothing is memorable <num>
i've been playing since season one hard to believe right ? this game made me fall in love with it but the updates ever since <num> have made the game a salty pool of luck broken mechanics and modesweapons that aren't balanced out before release the old players are leaving the new ones joining for the bandwagon before quiting after a few weeks of playing my friend got me stw and i love it so i hope that if and when br dies the devs [epic] don't do what they're doing to br nowadays epic if you see this andor it makes it your way please stop look at what br used to be and try to bring back the things old players enjoyed ps the weekly updates seemed great when they started in december but they have to stop or at the least be balanced fair mostly working (because ya bad things glitches and exploits occur) and skill based maybe even role based sincerly a season one veteran default
i personally enjoy this game the gameplay is great besides the major lag that needs fixed i mean those really negative reviews out there are not needed rating this magnificent game a <num> or <num> is not needed a <num> or <num> fits it better i would recommend this game to others if they can handle lag spikes but this game has really good potentially it just needs a minor cleaning of things
this is a paid closed beta but nowhere in the description does it mention this don't waste your money
if you intend on also playing on pc buyplay and link your account on pc first if you play on xbox first epic will lock this game to xbox only it doesn't even matter if you bought the game for both epic will only tell you to make a second account so for those of us who play epic's other games such as unreal tournament or paragon they expect us to create a secondary account just to play fortnite on pc tl : dr link and play fortnite on pc first or you will have to create a second epic account
seriously what epic has done to shotguns is sad all the little noob don't need to be spoonfed skill ! i haven't even hit over <num> with one of the strongest if not the strongest shotty in the game it's really pathetic on how epic has managed to somehow make shotguns one of the worst things to have with you you have a very small chance of getting a <num> shot or <num> with any shotty this new meta also ruins the point of building ou just constantly get lasered and shot down by horrible players with smgs plus in squads almost every team are sweats with loads of smgs (good luck with that) these guns are based on pure luck no skill included spray and pray is the meta this game actually used to be fun (until season <num> smg patches and ridiculous shotty nerfs) if you wish to start playing now just pick up mainly smgs and other spraying weapons <emoji>
i dislike that the shotguns are literally snipers and how overpriced skinsemotes etc are but the game is addicting also please stop finishing me right when my teammate is attacking you tryhards
can it stop crashing on season <num>
it is fun but i cant play save the world anymore because whenever i go on it it says to claim the rewards for a mission but when click on it it says that i cant cause a deferral key is active and when i click continue it just sends me back to claim the rewards and into an endless loop
your game is no wonder it gives people anger problems just take it down from the store
this is the most unbalanced piece of ever to exist kirby battle royale or minecraft hunger games would honestly be a better choise at this point
lag fest camp fest and guns arent programmed right go pubg
i love this game and i can't wait for the jetpacks this is awesome i love this do you
i cant hear footsteps anymore so i die instantly
my issues here really aren't much with the game itself game has a cool visual style to it i'm a big fan of the ability to just build fortifications when where and how you want some mechanics take a little getting used to but not the worst learning curve i've encountered no my issues begin and end with the fact that they are selling a closed beta to a free to play game for $ <num> basically what they are selling you is $ <num> worth of ingame purchases and you are paying them to beta test their game for them it's a kickstarter campaign marketed as a full game this brings me to what really bothers me and it is that in none of their marketing did they make clear that this is only a beta nor were they upfront about this being destined for freetoplay status even on this page that fact is barley a footnote i would probably feel different if they had been more transparent about what this really is or they didn't charge a full $ <num> again not a horrible game but not worth the fee
after playing for <num> minutes i developed brain cancer
review of battle royale and save the world fortnite has two game modes a paid pve save the world and a free <num> player pvp battle royale i will refer to the modes as stw and br in this review although i really don't like this game i will still give an honest unbias review to start off stw is more for a player with time to give while br is just something to play when your bored or for a player who just wants pure action i really don't like how epic games focuses primarily on the br game mode for example all of the screenshots for the game is the br map another example is that they changed the whole game's name to "fortnite battle royale" stw deserves more attention considering br probably wouldn't exist if stw was never made the building feature creates a unique aspect of fortnite making it a very popular and competitive game for most ages overall epic games does a great job at keeping their game relevant with the weekly content updates and interesting map changes
wow what a pathetic trash kiddie game cant escape cheaters on any platform now with keyboard and mouse cant wait for this movement to die trash kids
i like the cosmetics and understand why they cost money but what i dont understand is why people rage that you have to pay for them its not like it gives you any advantage that make people think that you might put up a good fight and people dont look at the fact yha their cool but epic needs some way of getting money to pay the people who contantly work on the game trying to make it better so player can play but you need to fix your shotguns epic
its a amazing game ! but fix the severs because i cant get in my game to see season <num> <emoji>
the game was fun at the start a way of competition to pubg you could say now its terrible its not fair in any way the community are just a bunch of very rude and immature kids who know nothing more this game is a pure example that games are not improving but getting worse i don't ever want to see this game again
great game but give us free skins too
when i first started playing i knew it was going to be a great game and it was and was playing at the time around season <num> and it is still a great game
so the thing that ruins the game the most is the fact you don't gain anything for winning or getting a kill mostly vbucks not only that the save the world game mode was said to be free by <num> but we are half way into <num> and it still costs money basically false advertising right there
ok now im done you dont want to fix it fine your product is now just going to be reported for poor performance i have asked you guys to fix many times and sunk my hard earned money into it if you wont do anything then i will
it is good but very overrated a lot and it haves a lot of bugs the sikns are to expensive <num> $ <num> one
this pvp is garbage weapon damage is completely broken weapon color means nothing every shotgun will one hit kill you unless you are the one shooting at least pubg has a damage table that doesn't change
terribad trash game waste of zero dollars
this game is the epitome of "gets old fast" oh and micro transactions nuff said
this game was good now there are so many overwhelming updates that the game is getting the gunss are unbalened and every one has to rely on two shotguns epic games if you are reading this please listen
i literally wait for an hour to get in a server and once im done it keeps giving me more minutes they might as well have told me to go myself in the !
i went ahead and bought the $ <num> version of the game to play with <num> friends plus me and had planned to have a great experience with building fortresses shooting zombies playing with friends and gathering lots of loot the first <num> weeks felt like it was all going to be worth it but after all the repetitive gameplay and lack of worthwhile rewards i pulled the final straw when they deleted my castle which i had <num> pieces left a place on the map and now i have <num> stacks of stone sitting in my bank reminding me that all the <num> hours of work i put in to my castle of solitude was for nothing don't come to this game if you're looking for a creative outlet and some fun gameplay that will last you more than a week
games community is toxic and weapons are unbalanced and i suggest paying for pubg because at least thats not toxic
any game made by epic is epic at first then slowly dies a good example is the gears franchise and now this this game has so many unbalanced mechanics that its more rngspam based than skill based don't believe me find the compact smg (p <num> ) or anything automatic using small ammo new to the game or don't play enough ? great ! you'll run into more sweaty build god players who play this game almost <num> that you won't be able to learn the game because you'll be dying so much (hiding all game doesn't help either) oh and if you already know how to play great ! you'll have a boring build off of who can build faster than just height advantage the enemy player you like the skins and emotes ? pay $ <num> $ <num> for them each this game is popular because of streamersyoutubers possibly being paid by epic games to promote it btw if you didn't know fortnite br has made <num> billion dollars in a year so its very possible ; otherwise not many players would be playing this tl ; dr don't install !
limmiting building materials updating to appeal to new players only not old day <num> player here and used to play every day but quit due to people who build so fast now a days i literally cant play for fun i allways have to try my hardest and it used to be perfect but now the games popularity has began the downfall of fortnite i can build really fast but the people who are "better" than me are the toxic people that say im just bad this toxic community defends fortnite with their lives and are blinded by the choices epic is going forword with
i hate this game doesent deserve to be popular online open your eyes the games bad game deserves to die
the best part of the game is the building aspect if this game didn't have building it would be like any other survival game keep up the astonishing work <emoji>
still a fun game you get little in reward for your efforts getting better version of playable characters (leveling up a uncommon will never beat a epic etc) or the character themselves are very rare that you might easily drop <num> to get it or you might not dupes are common do have a purpose though the roll packs are very little reward for the most part i suggest waiting till its free lots of crashing as well
dont get me wrong its a good game but i bought the founders pack and i was almost to the end of the tutorial i encountered glich the mini llamas don't work plz someone dont waste your time getting save the world but please fix it
the battle royale can die in a fire i rather play the simpsons wrestling on ps <num> !
this game is trash and boring all luck based as well
it doesn't load and it say"pc or mac' over and over !
how am i supposed to get <num> chest from wailing woods if the game dosen't guarantee the one chest that spawns their and fight between the other <num> people who land in a microscopic hut again <num> times the games trash don't get me started on the lag or how people manage to pull out their glider right as they land or how people shoot through <num> different walls while im trying to heal or how gernades from grease grove reach me from tiled thx epic fix your game or the challenge choose
i would've given for fortnite <num> stars but it has good game play but it's way too luck based it has way too much which isn't a game it's very hard to win when there's so many glitches were you can't shoot the gun and where you fall to your death after usinsing your glider also it's annoying when somebody shoots a door kills you while it's the door and go through it and kills you
want to know where all the scummy xbox players are ? look no further
this games launch is a joke first of all however my biggest issue is the fact that no where in the description of the game that you buy is there a warning that this is infact a closed beta the game is in shambles as far as i can tell which would be fine if i had been givin a warning as to the fact that it is not a full game that will be release in the spring of <num> some of you may say i should have looked at game reviews but i should not have to use game reviews to find out if a game is prerelease or not overall just don't buy this microtransaction garbage
fortnite should have a turtorial onto how to play this gameand the sad part isis that people will hunt noobs just for a free kill and if your not tryharding then forget about winning you'll die from unbalnce weapons you should have levelskills based matchmaking so dont download unless you want to get an brand new tv because you broke your tv
ok so this games damage system is bad when im in point blank range with a tac shotgun i should do high damage but thats not the case i just got done with a match and i had <num> health and a green tac shotty and my enemy had <num> and a ar and i get a headshot and did <num> damage and got raped
its fun and addictive but the new update ruined it completely the game lags way to much and ruins the experience old fortnite was better
game won't even open anymore
the game has too many crashes and cra almost finished with tier <num> defense need to fix bugs with game
the fact that people hype this game as much as they do means that the human race is doomed the community is really freakin' toxic consider how 'bout half the world spend their lives on this game and put that together with their toxicity and you will understand this dire situation
pros : the building is ok and the guns feel nice cons : missions get boring and just trying to do sidequests get hard and boring and the player base is <num> little kids <num> scammers and <num> who are trying to enjoy this empty game where you have to buy coins or the founder edition just to have good things then gets taken by some scammer so please dont buy this and spend your cash on something else like overwatch or battlefield <num>
the more you add to the game the worse it gets shotguns are utter trash now and the game gets buggier
epic we dont need more guns we need better servers to handle your growing number of players
good but i wis i could play with ps <num> players
not for the casual player who just wants to play a game after a long day of work if you're a try hard with too much free time then this is the game for you pubg has an overall better rating and its broken and cost $ <num> that should tell you all you need to know about fortnite
be careful playing this game it's highly addictive my only problem is shotgun damage wish they were actually shot guns and not pea shooters
im only putting <num> stars becuase ps <num> gets cool free stuff and we dont if we dont get any thing i will delete fortnite
this last update made the lag worse than it was before needs fixed asap
it is a real shame of the new view i can only see half my screen
now i have played other royale game like the culling and pubg but none compare to fortnite why ? well you jump out of a flying vehicle and land somewhere on a well thought out highly detailed island you stock up on loot and start killing other unfortunate players who crossed paths with you collect building materials so you can defend yourself and others if you play duos and squads with all this happening a huge barrier (the storm) closes in on all <num> players if you win you get a message saying <num> victory royale ! and the alltowellknown umbrella repeat ! i mainly like fortnite because of the strategy used when you die you can learn your mistakes like "i didnt build" or "i forgot crouching makes you accurate" really the only thing i dont like are fortnite trolls but those are rare that was my opinion i hope it helped !
i cant get it on my xbox life on my laptop i need help
thought i was buying done retail game not another early access gimick start screen saying closed beta was shocking constant crashes & lag super harsh durability is boring pay to play microtransactions as usual just wait for finished free version next year
i dont like how you cant download fortnite on a computer plz change this
i have had this game since it came out i fell in love with it immediately nearly every part of the game perfect then the game started feeding its money from skins and season passes that was really the beginning of the end epic started adding stupid and unnecessary items rather than fix any of the game breaking bugs and exploits seems like they're worried more about making skins more than anything else lets not forget the unbelievable skill gap network connection (which used to be perfect) and the unnecessary amount of items the amount of items in this game come pretty close to the amount of experiencable issues as well it's a shame to see how far this game has gone downhill
i've been playing since season one and it got better in season <num> and <num> but then they started to go downhill more debuffs and buffs start coming along with glitches the rpg radius was debuffed making it more likely not to hit anyone even on direct contact then shotguns were debuffed making it more likely to do <num> damage to a player with a pump or tact then c <num> s were buffed making it be able to destroy half a building in tilted then the shopping cart glitch and the walking through walls glitch happened then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ars and other guns fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a victory royale <num> or <num> vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more moneyi hope u found this useful
it used to be amazing but now it crashes
epic please try adding bots for no fill playground mode please thank you
this game currently is the definition of a pay to win (progress) game it got horrible roll rates even when buying llamas you'll get crap or dupes upgrading doesn't change rarity if you want a certain character you better be lucky or willing to drop alot of money no good rewards the collection bonus gives a good reward at <num> then nothing till <num> then <num> really ? crashing alot excepted of a beta but you have to pay to play right now which doesn't really make it a beta beta are tests this is a full buggy game that they charging you for and calling it a beta well this is early access well tone down buggy and up the rewards so far the game got a good concept but it lacks the reward
i love the game itself and i don't like that it will not load into the season <num> game
repetitive and boring same thing every match
the game is good if it doesn't crash which it doesn't for me and if it does well it's free so it's not like you wasted money on it also being bad at the game is not an excuse for making a bad review saying there's too many tryhards and unbalanced weapons
could do with less lag
fortnite used to be aa good game (season <num> and half of season <num> ) and it's not even about skill pumps do no damage and noobies end up get the best loot and can kill you easy atlest add it to where we are ranked in so we get people on our skill level and not firstgame noobs or console ninjamyth if we're not on that skill level
epicgames needs to give xbox players a free skin
the best game in bugs
fix save the world mode there are many bugs and crashes in that mode that aren't getting any attention how could you just push what should be a good game to the side and only improve battle royale save the world should be looking better than br
this game is takin over kids lives
probably the most toxic game i've played the community is <num> x more toxic than the minecraft community when the better together update came out if you don't own a skin then your considered a noob which isn't right shotguns literally do <num> damage to the head while your enemy one taps you with <num> damage jetpacks make the player impossible to hit the lag is atrocious and needs to be fixed because people can shoot through walls when season <num> came the whole game began to fall apart but the developers dont care about the acual problems they only care about adding new skins and weapons so they can trick <num> year olds into stealing their mom's credit card so epic can fill up their wallet if you haven't installed this game dont it's not worth your time to download this awful game that leeched it's success from pubg
let us play against ps <num> people
i think that fortnite should have <num> stars not <num> this game is way over hyped it's mediocre at best it's very repetitive and it's boring when you play by yourself one more thing all of the customization stuff is too expensive even though the game is free it's still not worth emptying your pockets for a stupid skin that looks cool the legendary skins cost $ <num> which equals <num> vbucks it's slightly fun when you're playing with friends i would not recommend to anyone
pure piece of if u play this game idk how u sleep at night not all its hype to be
it sucks dont get very bad
everything seems fine to me
just so you know the shotguns need to be nerfed this game ruined <num> friendships
love the game but since the recent i cant even play it the game will load up and get to the menu then the screen will just turn black out of nowhere and go back to my xbox home screen can yall fix it please ?
okay fortnite needs an update the game kinda sucks ! for example when you build something you or an enemy sometimes can go through it ! it's horrible when you're trying to have a build battle with someone there is not many benefits so you suck epic ! <emoji>
pump headshot does <num> <emoji>
rendering video boundry connection team mate all new issues but hey got new flowers and ac unit in windows just another garbage game now
i didnt know i was paying to be an epicgames beta tester this game would be fun if it wasn't broken the constant crashing needs a fix asap if you're on the fence about this game here are some things you should know it's pay to win it's not finished and still very broken it comes out free to play next summer so save your money unless you want to be a beta tester as well
the game has gotten better with these last updates it seems to run smoother even in <num> v <num> that gamtype i lagged alot it was so bad people were invisible i still get annoyed with bloom shots but its whatever just weird you can hit someone and not do damage ? cool thing is that you guys update frequently and add new things to the game the challenges are a big plus as well !
epicgames claims the game is "fair" that is until you unload an entire shotgun in someone and they just shoot you with a pistol once the amount of bs this game pours out is bad enough in addition they cant even make their own emotes but rather copy dances and gestures i'd recommend pubg if you are looking for a game that has significantly less lag bs cheaters and server problems server problems happening all the time as in about five times a month on top of that it takes hours or days to get through a login queue just to have it fail and wait again if you plan to buy the game if you haven't already save your money the game is too broken
it doesent let me play !
it was fun but now the screen wont fit
i love this game ! it cured my cancer <emoji> !
fix the shotguns and take out smgs
its fine but the lag ruins the whole game
fortnite is an ok game but it needs improvment this game has changed too much over the past few months and some stuff in the game is dumb <emoji>
fortnite used to be a fun but challenging game now its full of too many guns too many gimmicks and full of people in the fanbase that want things that will make the game even more luck based than it already is its should be pretty easy to fix your game epic

fortnite is the most autistic game it inverted my penis
wish a <num> star review as an option why ? because this bootleg of pubg is overrated overplayed trash love microtranactions that are overpriced ? love unbalenced and broken weapons ? love terrible building system ? love a toxic fanbase ? then this game definitely for you and the rest of their retarded community who doesn't like seeing it everywhere on youtube mixer twitch etc ? who doesn't like amazing youtubers and streamers going from pumping out beautiful content to only posting and streaming fortnite ? every person who said no then congratulations ! your one of the rare people who isn't a fortnit crackhead and if you said yes theres something called rehab and me and all the sane people who said yes strongly recommend it for you and breaking news as of writing this review i've ust received a fortnite looking for group post this is what i mean its everywhere <num>
the game constantly freezes and lags when in combat and by the time your screen unfreezes you have already been killed and looted weapons are incredibly unbalanced and give players a huge unfair advantage (hand cannon and basically any legendary) absolute trash just man up and cough up the$ <num> for pubg on steam you lazy cheapskates even the xbox one port is better than this mistake
i like that we can as many people and win but i hate the lag
a game with so much potential but with so many problems ! the lag is horrible the game's controls are horrible the overall gameplay is horrible along with that so many people hack on this game and makers do nothing about for example how is it that i unloaded a legendary rifle in a players back each round making contact just for him to turn around and shoot me in the foot while having <num> hp and shield and i die by the way it showed him with full hp and shield ask anyone who plays this game and they'll probably tell you its horrible too
i cant play one f°°°°°° match without lagging <num> i move one inch an get thrown around like a frickin rag doll would i recommend this game ? no it sucks more than a stripper on a dollar tuesday
fortnite's pve has decent rewards and a player can earn legendary guns and v bucks which are quite useful for many purposes pve sadly is quite buggy at high level missions and many newcomers will ask and beg for free items which can be rather annoying fortnite pvp lately has been focused on their greed for money (tragic) constantly releasing cosmetics and skins instead of addressing lag crashing and horrible gun imbalances is rather sad epic games just another large game company taking advantage of kids w their parents credit card i recommend far cry <num> battlefield <num> or star wars bf <num> not p <num> p and rather enjoyable warning : if you don't sweat extremely hard every single match until you have a stroke fortnite battle royale is not for you i hope my detailed review was useful to you best of luck ! updated : double pump is back pretty much why ! no skill to this game at all just build spam or hide play something else honestly go outside maybe
i just preordered and it looks amazing ! im looking foward to this game i love survival games <emoji>
i started this game about a week after season <num> started and instantly fell in love this game was amazing and fun in every aspect and then epic started listening to the season <num> and <num> noobs then next thing you know the shotguns are nerfed then gathering materials is nerfed and so is editing double shotty and wallstructure health they even increased bloom on most weapons ! then here comes the smg's this smg meta has torn apart the game more then anything and the fact that their is no double shotty to counter it is sad very sad building is what made this game unique and fun and it was just about the only skill gap in the game now it doesn't even matter how fast you build or who is the better builder it's about who has the better smg and who gets lucky with there bloom shots literally it's making games shorter because their is rarely any build fights anymore not to mention that shotguns are completely garbage now i am probably gonna start playing realm royale for now on
i just preordered this game and it looks amazing ! still a bit worried about that $ <num> though
most over rated game in the world !
this game causes extreme stress and anxiety the game is heavily luck based and is not welcoming to new players the developers just make the game worse instead of bettr and on top of that they do not listen to the community and listen to the child fanbase the game causes a lot of anger and is anything but fun i do not recommend this game to anyone because i don't want them to get the same effects it caused me (anger stress and anxiety)so please do not play this game it is only welcome to very high skilled players and the devs don't listen once so ever so please spare yourself from the horror that is fortnite
shameful rip off of pubg packed with gimmicks that cater only to luck and crappy players cant win a firefight ? build some walls or hop around vigorously cant aim ? spam rockets and grenades cant figure out where to go ? the maps tiny so dont worry dont have an attention span ? thats ok theres very little content compared to games like pubg also always rewards luck over skill you could die the second your feet hit the ground because the other guys landing spot had something and yours didnt or you could make it to last two people with <num> kills and get blown up by a camping <num> year old with a lucky blind rocket shot it is free and kinda playable but you get what you pay for
this game is amazing and freethe first day when i started playing it i didn't know that there was skins that you can buy a couple days later i knew that i needed to get a skin but instead of buying the skins i bought save the world deluxe edition so i can get vbucks everyday
shotgun are not as in s <num> specifically the pump you can shoot some in the head <num> and body shot for <num> and you cant even finish people when their down you cant even finish them it shows the hitmarker but no damage
i really like the game i have been here since season <num> but i have one problem xbox doesnt have free skins like ps <num> so xbox needs free skins in fortnite
the game would rival pubg as a free game but laggy controlls the v buck cost way to much some guns are useless or sometimes for example riffles way to op the graphics are aa grade for a free game and the custom building is nice ! i do not like battle royale though maybe add in like a <num> v <num> tdm or <num> v <num> war mode the game is really just a battle royale and it has no incentive to win so stars its <num> until thats fixed or i will check out the pve when it is free then maybe it will deserve a <num> or <num> star i really wanted to give this a bad review but i have hope for this game it has constent updatesgood luck <emoji>
i highly recommend this game it is free updates every week different game everytime you play it
i <num> st played this game in september and this game was amazing it had no toxic <num> year olds they listened to the fans ect until season <num> when they blow up to <num> million players they got so money hungry and greedy they stoped listening to the og season <num> player and only listened to the noobs of season <num> and <num> they did awful changes like the removal of the old song that people enjoyed added useless weapons like the stink bomb port o fort ect made the game isolated by the stupidity added smg meta and disappearing skill gap and worst of all they even added a <num> increased bloom count to make the game more "noob friendly ! " but still people spend stupid amounts of money on the galaxy skin battle pass ect the game is still the most viewed game on youtube and twitch even though they lost <num> million players after july it's got sooo cancerous that "ail a and fortnite clickbait are everywhere that i can't even watch a single video without fortnite so in my opinion fortnite will die
good for epic games to have the where with all to make this type of game
so we dont earnv coins and it glith alot dont wast your time download it
i dont enjoy the fact all the people who paid for the founders pack got kicked asside by stupid free battle royal i feel betrayed and i will no longer be purchasing or supporting content from epic games
great and fun shooter game with creative skins and emotes
south african servers would be nice
this game copied pubg and is starting to call every dance "the fortnite dance"
all people do is camp behind trees or build a tower to hide in what is the fun in that imo its pretty much like call of duty but with building towers and more players in the match
