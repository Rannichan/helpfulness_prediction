__label__helpful this stupid game ruins friendships . all my friends only play this stupi game and when they say theyll play , they just keep playing forever and never do anything else , this game is stupid
__label__helpful pvp battle royale mode : ive noticed some people complaining about fortnights br vs pubgs br and i wanted to explain a few points <num> . fortnights br is far better at this point at fixing problems and bringing updates out while pubg has a harder time at it <num> . fortnights br is focused on building mechanics while pubg is more focused on vehicles meaning more drive by shootings <num> . fortnights br has a smaller map and because of that you get more action while pubg has a larger map meaning . less action <num> . fortnights br although cartoony has better graphics in the long haul then pubgs more realistic style <num> . fortnights br gliders are more fun and useful then pubgs not so well done parachutes <num> . fortnights br weapons are simple pick up and shoot weapons while pubgs weapons are reasonably complex with lots of different . attachments and fire rate modes <num> . fortnight br is free while pubg costs $ <num> . <num> both are fun just depends on your play style
__label__unhelpful this game is great ! one must remember this is a game in preview so dont expect it to be perfect aand it isnt fornite or call of duty either ! this is battle royale ! so go scavenge and have fun ! ps . please dont give it a bad review because you suck . ijs !
__label__helpful my final review on pubg . ive owned since day <num> and the only things that have seen improvement is network lag , frame rate and hasnt crashed in months on me . beyond that to put it bluntly . its garbage . hit recognition is worse than ever , shots still dont fire on reticle most times and horrible desync issues . game audio is also buggy at times with footsteps and shot direction even through headset . i cant and dont recommend this game to anyone in the state its in .
__label__helpful ubisoft is bowing down to the cruel communist regime of china . in the next season , they will censor parts of the game for communist audiences . uninstalled .
__label__helpful tachanka doesnt have a segway <num>
__label__unhelpful everything works great , but its still a downgraded version of the full pc game
__label__unhelpful it feels like a rushed to be finished product , drifty aiming , lagfest .
__label__helpful minecraft at its mehist . if you recently upgraded to win <num> on one of your phones this is easily a priority to pickup . win <num> edition is basically pocket edition ported over to the new ms os . the game runs a lot better than the original java version making it a viable substitute for underpowered laptops as well . it has a few drawbacks though . one the interface is meant for phones so dont expect sensible pc design but rather pudgy phonlet design . two you dont get some of the same freedoms that you can get with the regular java version . as far as i know there is no way of moding or skining this version of minecraft , and the windows store indicates there are or at least will be in app purchases so skins that you have to pay for . i havent tested everything in the game more of just skimmed to see if the other reviews are correct and indeed this just seems to be a mobile port for the time being .
__label__unhelpful this game is overrated as . the combat is and it ruined any chance of any new fps games having a good multiplayer .
__label__helpful i absolutely love the tactical realism in this game . one mistake and youve lost . i do wish that there was a friendly fire option . i also wish that blackbeards weapon shield had a better duration . but other than that i think it is a very good game , it really keeps you on edge . i hope ubisoft keeps up with the amazing products .
__label__unhelpful ihave been playing fortnite for about a year , and lemme tell you , its amazing . the controls are easy to learn and whhen playing , the sreen is not crowded with info like a lot of some other pvp games . because the game is not close to being done , though , fn has frequent updates which make the gameplay smoother and better . some people complain of lag , but after a full year , i only encountered one laggy moment that lasted about <num> seconds . i highly recommend that you play this game and experience the awesome community , strategy , and fun gameplay . may you get the wins
__label__helpful constantly boots me back to the dash . if you cant run your program without it crashing , then it isnt ready for beta . fix your .
__label__helpful great game , good graphics , very competitive , addicting af many operators to choose from . the game really gives you a perspective of what its like in warfare . <num> game , maybe ubisoft can make a way how to get credits instead of buying them , but i can understand they dont do that . but dont play it if you have mcdonalds wifi .
__label__helpful minecraft windows <num> is definitely the best minecraft platform ! i was always dreaming about a minecraft that shows up on the start screen , and here it is ! i can finally play minecraft without worrying about all the . minecraft folder nonsense about needing to download so many things ! i can only ask some changes to be made as this will catch up to pc and xbox editions . first , i want to ask that chests have the same interface as the pc and xbox . another is that i want there to be commands like in the pc . that way , you could make mini games . i love how it can crossplatform with the pe (although the pe isnt updated yet) . it says <num> stars but ill give it <num> stars . plus , the touch screen controls are so reliable . i like how many features the pc has , but it is often slow and crashes servers a lot . the xbox is easy to do parkour with , but has problems with controls . the pe is annoying with only touch screen and small buttons . therefore , the w <num> edition is the best edition ! (deborahs son) : )
__label__unhelpful like most people i have played pubg on pc for a long time . i was excited to share this experience with my xbox live friends . after playing it on the xbox i am truly disappointed . it runs like garbage . i understand it is still in the developmental stage but come on . the initial stages on pc were worlds better .
__label__unhelpful from the lobby to the action on the ground there is constant lag and framerate droppage . its fun but im playing on an xbox one x , there shouldnt be a problem like this .
__label__unhelpful great update but each time i try to pause it , it freezes and i cant do anything so i have to force close it but other than that its amazing that it is now an official store game instead of pc online download it runs faster and much smoother please fix the bugs thanks : d
__label__unhelpful when salty peopl team kill , glich , ect . its so hard to play . also , if you dont get season pass <num> new operator cost <num> , <num> renown . ridiculs ! fix the whole game ! it looks nothing like the trailer ! ubisoffixseige
__label__helpful its alright game but it gets boring . you jump out you either die or get stuff and then wander for <num> minutes only to die or get hot from all sides . here come the git gud people but i dont want to try to get better if i have to go through that every game
__label__helpful first off i did not hate this game entirety , just that , you know just dropped the base game into apit of fire
__label__helpful it runs well , less laggy , and enjoyable . its easy to use and understand . its incredibly cool , so glad it works . so fun , i love it !
__label__helpful becoming more and more trash everyday update cant even join a match now
__label__helpful bring back the irst theme song
__label__helpful garbage game with awful mechanics . the whole game is spamming structures and hoping your guns hit the target . battle royal needs to die already . maybe try an actual skilled base game , and not free trash games . this game gets way to much credit for absolutely nothing . any game company that makes cash off of micro transactions is retarded . epic , why did you give upp gears for this trash !
__label__helpful it doesnt load and it saypc or mac over and over !
__label__helpful the controls are . clunky and need work . other then that its a solid game for the preview program and im sure frame rate issues will be fixed . being worth $ <num> is debatable but in my opinion its not much of a stretch and i recommend .
__label__unhelpful diese version macht riesige fortschritte und wird bald die java edition einüberholen .
__label__unhelpful this game is a mix of the xbox version , (with the loading screen , inventory , ect) the mobile version , (the placement and movement) and barely feeling anything like that of the original pc version . i think its alright with the new additions with the weather and so on , but otherwise , it just doesnt feel right . ive had no problems with loading it , updates , or any other problems so far .
__label__helpful i had thoughts of commiting pubg before i got this spectacular game but then i realized life is worth living after playing a couple rounds . the graphics are so realistic and the way the game has complete noobs going up against pros is so fair and balanced . i also love the variety . all <num> of this games maps are breathtaking . i have spent <num> , <num> dollars on this masterpiece , but have yet to place in the top <num> . i have spent so much time and money on this art that i have been evicted from my apartment . i am writing this review from the welfare line . i accidentally ate all <num> of my children because i thought they were chicken nuggets , and this game helped me through those tough times . my wife left me because of my love for this game , and i got a roblox girlfriend the next day . thank you , fortnite , for saving my life !
__label__unhelpful message to mojan . the game does not listen to the music . no music is not a game .
__label__helpful the vbucks\coins you have to buy with real money which sucks . they should make it so that every level you get like <num> <num> coins . its such a stressful game aswell . atleast make a coin system . maybe like every win is <num> vbucks and every kill is <num> vbuck . that would make the game alot more enjoyable then it is right now .
__label__unhelpful this game is for autistic babies with nothing to do but waste their college funds on nothing more but virtual trash , so stop buying virgin bucks and get outside . reminder it rips off the pubg .
__label__unhelpful the game at its current state isjust bad
__label__helpful best game for kids and also for me . great source of knowledge helps me exploring world
__label__helpful after playing for <num> minutes i developed brain cancer
__label__helpful great game , but needs improvement . good graphics . not the best , but fits the game . smooth gameplay . it has a lot of glitches tho . and finally it has fun , interesting operators . each operator is unique in their own way . but at times this game plays like its the worst fps ever . <num> . errorconnection error . this happens a lot even tho my connection fine . <num> . matchmaking is still annoying . <num> . people are so disrespectful . people will kill u if u make a mistake , steal their kill , & or choose the operator they wanted . its so embarrassing . especially if they rage quit . plus half the kills are so nonrealistic . half of them are bs . btw each dlc operator is <num> k reown . kinda too much , but oh well . dont get me wrong , this game is amazing but needs improvement . its only worth it if it is $ <num> or less . plus if u going to get this game u are going to want to play with friends and use mic . until ubisoft fix this game , im not going to play this game <num> <emoji> ✌
__label__helpful all of the stuff added since minecraft came out is , for the most part , amazing . one of my few complaints is with how controlling horses has been changed its awful . if i wanted my horse to steer like one of those atvs in halo then i would go play halo . that was something that did not need to be changed , but now it needs to be changed back . also all of the colors and biomes meshing together makes reading a map impossible because unless youre looking for the desert . good luck telling anything apart . <num> would purchase minecraft for $ <num> when it first released again .
__label__helpful i originally rated this ☀☀ , but decided to change it after the respect for the developers . epic games are absolutely amazing at conveying patch notes , accountability , and showing their sense of urgency . this game has only got better and better . it doesnt compare to pubg and that is the point . all of the dummies saying they copied pubg are nieve . the same could be said for any title . does that mean there can only be <num> shooter , <num> racing game(do not buy project cars <num> ) , etc . of course not ! gather a friend and play duos or grab up to <num> and play squad . the game gets better and better as you do .
__label__unhelpful multiplayer is alright , terrorist hunt is better . extremely lacking offlinelocal multiplayer terrorist hunt unlike vegas <num> (which i loved) . campaign would have been nice as well . feels incomplete like titanfallevolve without one . it also needs a lot of work with balancing , it gets ridiculous when im shot through two walls by someone spraying a shotgun or when im shot immediately at the start of a round .
__label__unhelpful servers have <num> minute que at times just to log in , and thats just the volume from only preorder players . sometimes after the que , login fails , and restarts que from the beginning ! framrates drop hard at times , almost as if the game freezes . missions are recycled , after playing <num> + hours ive only come across <num> or <num> different mission types . overhyped and unpolished , which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game .
__label__helpful first wheres the mods and i like love it out loud !
__label__unhelpful frame drops in the beginning of every fight , guns not balanced at all , map is to small for <num> players and seems like gun fights are random if you win or not . i will just hold out for pubg to drop .
__label__helpful i like windows <num> pocket editions and all but one of the good things is that it isnt as laggy as the other version for the pc(weli know why) . but i am waiting for future updates . so i can trade with the villagers and all that . hopefully for adding the mods can be a lot easier to do for this version . also when you pen in animals and you go far away or even sometimes leave the game and come back , the animals are gone . i wish there was a way to keep them and not have to have one sitting to get , breed , and then slaughter all the animals . it would be too long of time to do so .
__label__unhelpful feels like a cheap rework for xbox aiming is slow even on max sensitivity and we get at most <num> fps but can go lower down to <num> . needed more time and full release comes out in <num> days so it better be fixed by then .
__label__unhelpful this version might seem pretty useless since you can get minecraft pc on windows , but there are a ton of cool features this has that pc doesnt have ! the main feature would be the crossplay this has with pocket edition , so you can play with yours friends who have the mobile version of the game . you can also get this version of minecraft for free if you own pc minecraft , which is pretty cool . overall its an amazing game . one of the best apps on the windows store . keep up the good work , mojang ! : d
__label__helpful i havent been able to play this game in ages and it is finally back in my life . i think this is a great game for all ages . and it is an amazing use creativity you can build almost anything accept for round things with a smooth surface lol . and now since it has been updated we now have sea creatures like squids i cant remember anything else in the in the sea but still cool . bottom line you should definetely download this app it will change how you use your creativity
__label__helpful fun , unfinished garbage . controls are broke as hell . it loves to crash , a lot .
__label__unhelpful would probably be any better on a larger screen (tv) ? you can really pass time fast with this and after being in the hospital for almost three years this helps many daily blues until i can get back home ! thanks so much .
__label__unhelpful for skilled players ? oh its a great game ! from someone who played regularly , this game is cancer . the community team kills over characters , even in ranked . not to mention the crosshairs are bugged as fak . put the cross hair of a single fire ump over a targets face , one in multiplayer then tested in custom game , even ads semi auto , missed <num> out of <num> . mind you we aimed at the target , didnt input , no ghoststick , just flat on nose . so i hate call of duty , but i would rather play advanced warfare . n that game , to me , suuuuuuuuuuucked ! but at least my hitmarkers register . failure thy name is siege
__label__unhelpful when dose the <num> . <num> update come out
__label__helpful a couble bugs and a little laggy but still able to enjoy the game <emoji>
__label__unhelpful first off , there are a few cool little things here and there . like the new boat mechanics and being able to create spawners and such . however , the ui is unbearably minimalistic and awkward to navigate . i would like to have more information and options than just a few sliders and some onoff buttons . now , as far as the controlresponsiveness . this is by far my biggest complaint , it feels like im playing on a console , not in a good way . although its supposed to be the windows <num> version of minecraft , this was clearly designed for a controller . even with a very high framerate , it still felt unresponsive at times . i will say that performance is great , until it crashes . <num> minutes in i had just found a village aaaaaand . crash . i am currently disappointed at this attempt . it looks like an xbox game it plays like an xbox game it may as well just be a new version for xbox . why windows <num> ? until they make it more crossplatform compatible , i really dont see the point .
__label__unhelpful im about to win but then it lags me off my teams building and i get shot by the enamy team
__label__helpful we will fix the game and servers
__label__helpful 실행시 설정을 누르면 나가지고 , 게임도중 백색화면이 나오고 , 블루스크린이 뜨는 등 . 여러가지 이상한 현상이 나타나네요 . 알파 출시때에는 고쳐주시기 바랍니다 .
__label__helpful brilliant , and can be fun but in ranked you often get abandon penaltys for no reason , or you get a penalty for the bad servers shutting down which is unfair . i have also experienced heavy losses from my team rage quitting or getting removed for team killing , which counts against you . the whole ranked system is nonsense , it suppose to set you with players your skill but i find myself against a bunch of platinum players (a very high rank) and im a bronze rank . but however if you manage to get a good team or not get kicked the game is pretty fun and is really realistic , and the graphics are amazing , if you play this game ranked or not i recommend you squad up with some buddies , and use communication .
__label__unhelpful nothing short of a mix of games that have been out for years with regurgitated left <num> dead graphics . if you like completely unoriginal things , go ahead and dump your money into this joke that is somehow even less funny than destiny <num> .
__label__unhelpful how about you start charging for the game so you dont waste your time with your servers and spend more time making the game good
__label__helpful i hate the lag because its getting me killed
__label__unhelpful what obviously is the best thing about this is version is the performance . running on c++ or something of that sort , it much outperforms the java version . however , there are a few problems . first of all , the user interface is designed for smartphones or touch displays , however most pc minecrafters use mice . second of all , there is quite noticeable input lag , probably from vsync or something of that sort . and finally , player bumping . just no .
__label__unhelpful i open up the game its in the task bar its the mojang logo for a few seconds then it shuts down and isnt in the task bar anymore i also uninstalled it and reinstalled it but its still not working any more i have a question for you bill gates why is this not working like god damn i have a windows ten computer and all the reqirements so please fix this damn bug in the system
__label__helpful he launches exploading hocky pucks into your room , suddenly the kill feed is filled with an octopus man gets your team killed . i saw <num> kill then another and another , i was then the last man on my team . then i saw it said round won . i saw the kill feed and he killed the hostage . i still see him in my nightmares , i see him in my window at night . he still scares me to this day .
__label__unhelpful call of duty bs on steroids . ubisoft made a game where its all about trick shots and compleley unrealistic fighting . no weapon sway , you pretty much have to get a headshot because of ridiculous running around corners again and again , some characters move at near light speed while fighting .
__label__unhelpful there is nothing else quite like it except fortnite but not everyone likes cartoons . further more it is extremely confusing to learn but also very fun when it works . <num> worth the <num> bucks . my one and only complaint asside from the early acess bugs is no first person only servers !
__label__unhelpful what has made me mad is the crashes they mess me over so many times and frame rate i thought it was going to be frames from the computer but instead we get this garbage
__label__unhelpful cant play one game in mexico without crashing latest update now made russia crash daily . no reason for a game to be out for this long still have this many issues . no real reason to play this game , since you cant play this game . i feel like ive been robbed of my money .
__label__unhelpful great game and to those that gave it <num> star for graphics and fps or u suk but its in game preview meaning its gonna have problems do research before u complain about it idiots
__label__unhelpful so the people of india cant play fortnite on xbox ? common xbox and epic games i bought the console to play fortnite . you guys ruined all the excitement its a great game and i am not getting to play it since i live in india i hope you will fix this problem
__label__helpful i shoot someone cause they killed me last round and then i killed them and i got a banne for <num> hours what next
__label__unhelpful im broke but love to death minecraft and ive always wanted a pc version so for the love of god please make it free for <num> day or <num> hour please !
__label__unhelpful i like winnning i also like the <num> percent accuracy . also you only hate it because your trash
__label__helpful this game is hard . hard enough that it often infuriates those who are new to the game . this is a barrier to entry that must be overcome , but when it is this game becomes an exceptional experience . get through this barrier and you will have game worth many hundreds of hours . good luck .
__label__helpful i cant win , little kids <num> gud
__label__unhelpful this reminds me of dayz , the original armaii mod . it was amazing , and then a copy was made which was similar , but lacked the polish and authenticity . the newer version sucked , badly too . when i launched the game , i instantly felt like i was taking part of some poorly developed scheme . microsoft please , just because you have new ownership doesnt mean you need to prove to everyone that you can make what a few developers originally made . instead of making a beta minecraft , you should get a team and convert minecrafts java to c++ .
__label__unhelpful i like that the interface is great smooth and clean online player is much better but mods skins and the fact that it has nothing to do with your pc account witch is horrible . my pc and windows accounts different so when i play a sever it doesnt know me so get pc it has mods and slightly better layout
__label__unhelpful it was advertised as an open world survival fort builder but its not its a mission based defence game where you constantly run out of ammo and farm materials for about <num> minutes before you start a mission . so if you are looking to throw away <num> dollars and waste a large amount of time this is the game for you .
__label__unhelpful also the only game to be better day <num> than current
__label__unhelpful alice texas toast with peanut butter and chocolate milk please let me know if we have to work on my phone is it going today i am not in a good day i love that movie with you candy and chips please give me a phone
__label__helpful i really quite like the speed it runs at , much smoother than before . however it isnt recommended for anyone without windows <num> , since it will most likely crash as soon as you launch the game . but it is pretty much a polished version of the pocket addition so the ui is very big (unless you play this on a microsoft surface . in that case it should work to its fullest in terms of the ui) . but apart from that i think this version can grow into a nonlaggy smoother version of minecraft . unless you hate minecraft . in that case get out . sorry . but overall you should get this game since for now it should work on lowerend computers as long as you have windows <num> . now how do i go full screen ? (no really . how) ? also i love the new rowboats : p
__label__helpful nonstop lag throughout matches and poor gunplay and combat make this an incredibly frustrating experience . you spend the entire match looting and running all over the place to die upon your first encounter due to unbalanced weaponry . when you spend <num> or more minutes gathering items and building loot to only be oneshot by someone with the strongest weapon in the game , it really makes the whole point and time you spent in the game a waste . to not even be able to get one shot off really makes the game pointless to play . why spend a half an hour to not even be able to fire your gun once as the enemy with the best weaponry in the game to oneshot you ? this game is a literal waste of your time .
__label__unhelpful great to see ubisoft getting greedy with year two season pass and making players who dont have it wait <num> days to unlock the operators . along with year <num> dlc characters being overpowered , this game is just spawn rushing paytowin . and even casual is horrible now , when a team loses <num> or <num> rounds people just rage quit and now its a <num> v <num> with no fair way to win , along with ranked players level <num> playing casual like its ranked and spawn trapping ruining the game , and then smurf accounts going all recuit shotguns and nitro cells . this game went from fun and entertaining to survival of the sound wh <emoji> res
__label__helpful buy this game now its $ <num> . <num> on sale instead of $ <num> . <num> regular . <num> complaints for a $ <num> game . game crashing has been significantly reduced to the point that the crashes resulting from extended play sessions may be gone or almost entirely . make sure you uninstall and then fresh install after every single game update . ive played pubg nearly every single day since december <num> and have not lost hope on it . have some patience you crybabies , they are fixing it , even if they do sometimes seem a bit handicapped . as of june <num> th <num> , pubg on original xbox one with wired connection , (if you use wifi then everything is your own fault) , is in a much better state of playability , but that does not go without saying that the frame rate needs to be improved to <num> fps or preferably better (please give us <num> fps) , and any or all of the lag spikes need that may be remaining need to be smoothed out . tl ; dr ; play pubg , its still addicting & tolerable now ; you whinos can stop crying .
__label__helpful my only complaint would be that i cant carry over from my <num> or ps <num> . i got both copies a couple years ago , actually it was right after minecraft ps <num> edition came out , and i played the heck out of em . i have worlds with so much progress id love to be able to port over but cant . still fun game though .
__label__unhelpful i need those sweet sweet achievement points to fill the void left in me by my lack of social life . all i need to feel accepted is a little more gamerscore . but alas , the game fails to start , crashing after the mahjong logo , and preventing me from getting the euphoric dosage of minecraft achievements .
__label__helpful tired of being team killed on almost every match
__label__helpful i love how close the game is to the original . something i have noticed is that the cursor does not reposition itself in the center for the gui while using mouse and keyboard , throwing players off and forcing me to search for it . although not a big problem , does get a bit annoying . besides that , this game runs much smoother than the original even with all the updates being added on .
__label__unhelpful when u realize your original pve game is trash and got no sales so u gotta copy pubg .
__label__helpful i hope in the future , because of all the performance improvements , microsoftmojang decide to add city guards (knights , archers , generals) simply because it would be awesome during massive zombie sieges and when you are away from a city , to have guards protecting it if you roll solo . im hopeful about them adding stuff like that in the future , because right now the best defense we have are iron golems , and they seem to like to zone out and ignore some of the fighting . another issue with the golems is if they arent set to defend the village ( spawn from it ) they like to wander off and not return to defend . and during player warfare in online mode when it arrives , who doesnt want to build castles and hire guards to help you lay siege to defend a castle ! i really like all the new performance updates and such . all the new graphics look amazing , and i have a lot of villagers to tend to because i found a pretty large village .
__label__unhelpful with so many problems you still add to the game and ignore the problems that come with what you bring
__label__helpful minecraft is such a beautiful game on all platforms it has variety and a nice way to play with keyboard and mouse or controller or even with just your hands it noice
__label__unhelpful it should not need xboxlive like ps <num>
__label__unhelpful they need to stop updating battle royalefake pubg and start working on save the world
__label__unhelpful this game requires no skill , all luck . back then we had games like mw <num> and mw <num> . look what were stuck with now . i had more fun in <num> days playing blackout than in this minecraft generation game . good job epic <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the game is soo terrible . draw distance is garbage . frame drop to no end .
__label__unhelpful this game is a complete and utter piece of . every time they update it , they fix <num> minor problem and create at least <num> new problems . the devs have absolutely no idea what they are doing . besides robbing the players . its been <num> months and frame drops during close range gunfights are basically worse than when the game first came out . this game also has the worst dsync i have ever seen in a game . the pubg servers are trash . optimization is a joke . imput lag is atrocious at times . microsoft is a joke for allowing this game to have a $ <num> price rag . anyone still writing <num> star reviews are shilling for bluehole & microsoft . congrats everyone , we paid to be testers for these s game thats gonna be free in a matter of months .
__label__unhelpful i love this game so but when you went to the boss update it completed just destroyed it . now it wont let me play on my acer <num> in <num> tablet please fix this !
__label__helpful i enjoy playing minecraft , but im pretty much never able to because it crashes every time i try to play . will someone fix it , because i love minecraft and want to play .
__label__unhelpful everytime i try to download it says error like wtf
__label__unhelpful the graphics look like my
__label__helpful it doest tell th complete an full story from when tom clancy wrote rainbow six (for people who dont know its a real book) , but this game is so fun and addicting . at least it has horizons chemical (from book) . but all round gret game , has issues but ubisoft supports it .
__label__helpful i see people saying this is pay to win but that is just flat out liedelusion they tell themselves so they can hate on it . this is the first game in a long time that lets you earn premium game money ingame , you dont have to buy it with real money ! if thats your argument for why this game sucks , i feel sorry for you cuz you are gonna miss out on all the awesomeness that is fortnite ! (also , dont complain that its in beta , cuz everyone who has been waiting for this game knew that coming in , its not epic games fault you dont do your research) this game starts out slow cuz it wants to ease you into it . after about <num> or so missions , the game opens up and gives you more freedom . if you stopped after a few missions , thinking that was all the game was , you are <num> wrong (you eventually have free reign over your personal base , but in the beginning , you must do what they want you to) lastly , i have no problems joining with people , sooooo . i hope this clears everything up !
__label__helpful gonna need a lot of work for it to be completely done . but great game preview release . ill be here <num> ofrthe way as we advance <emoji> <emoji>
__label__helpful its great ! its minecraft , of course its awesome . one big(ish) problem is that when the player explores the world to much , like over an ocean or two , the size of the world becomes to big (like a somewhat small <num> mb to <num> mb) and when that happens , it causes extreme lag , even when staying in one chunk for a long time . that makes it hard to play because of the choppiness , unability for friends to easily join the world , and the mouse starts to get glitch and jumps around instead of being smooth . overall still an awesome game ! just wish that the stupid windows store would get an update so that download speed was normal .
__label__helpful crashes all the time . the crashes are more frustrating then the actual game play you cant tell me that they havent made enough money to fix this garbage . they wont make much more if not fixed .
__label__helpful right now , it may not seem like much but its in beta . this game will be much , much better with the plans ahead . in the next updates they will be adding cross platform play which means you can play with minecraft pe , xbox and pc users . they are also working on multiple inputs with means you can play with keyboards , controllers and touch pads . they are also going to add a built in game dvr so this is what i think it means , lets say you just did something really awesome and you didnt record it , some how you can go back and record it . ive heard the price will go up when its out of beta so you might want to buy it now when its cheap or , if you are a minecraft pc owner you can get this for free . well thats all the news ive heard thanks for reading .
__label__helpful ubisoft forces us to play a downgraded game just to satify the communistic chinese government
__label__helpful its fun but it had a specel feel when i started during christmas but it lost it whith season <num> and the glitches also building used tobe simpler so ya
__label__unhelpful well , the game lags too much , the hitbox are broken , the range of weapons and their spread are also broken , i died so many times to hackers with wall , speed , and aimbot hacks . my advice ? wait until pubg gets released on the xbox one this year . dont play this overhype garbage .
__label__helpful im a user of the original pc version of minecraft that allows you to use mods and personalize the experience . this is not that version , but it is an amazing experience nevertheless . having an optimized base game that requires no installers and is a truly clickandrun game , makes it extremely easy for me to share it and play with the rest of my family in shared worlds thanks to the friends tab in the play section . i like that you can personalize the skin of your character (you can find any skin you can imagine if you bing minecraft skins) and the fact that it has xbox achievements (im still trying to get all the wool colors) . overall a very fun and highly recommended minecraft version .
__label__helpful i loved it , its a great app very easy to get and i can affored it , the only problem is i can get mods . please add mods to your store .
__label__helpful the game had a rough launch but the support is fantastic . constant updates with game balancing in mind ; this game gets better everyday !
__label__helpful after disconnecting my microsoft account & trying to install while on my local account (on the pc itself) it finally installed . simple port of pocket edition . ambitious , but they need ui improvements asap !
__label__unhelpful every time i get into any game it freezes . reinstalled twice and tried atleast <num> games .
__label__helpful it takes some practice but its fun . the dlc can be bought with in game money you get for playing and they constantly balance the game and the dlcin game content
__label__helpful today i went to log into the game and it did the mojang screen like usual , and a changelog , then once i got those out of the way , i found a problem : the only thing that showed up was the background . no buttons , no title , no splash text . all it was : a blurry picture of a minecraft world . i cant find a solution to the problem and im not sure if it has been happening to others . if there was an update to fix this problem , id be happy .
__label__helpful this game is amazing but everyone is toxic
__label__helpful in my opinion , it is the perfect combination of mcpc & mcpe . i really enjoy playing it . easy to use , very simple . all around a great addition to the minecraft line !
__label__helpful the biggest problem is that everyone team kills and votes for you to be kicked and report you wtf . why is there friendly fire anyway this game has turned to . the hitboxes suck now everyone spawn kills or everyone goes outside fix your ubisoft
__label__helpful dis dun killed my
__label__helpful i love the way it lets you relax and build what u want . i all ways play this game . wither its pc or pe . i play this game all day every day when i can . its awesome if you havent played this experience the creative building and doing what ever you want ! sincerely , ashley d .
__label__helpful i love the game itself and i dont like that it will not load into the season <num> game
__label__helpful . i enjoy it , increasing in difficulty , mission variety , a genuine learning curve compared to a lot of games . joining others and seeing their designs have made me always want to use a few ideas . the leveling is extensive and loot seems fair , even for those getting the $ <num> version . despite slightsmall server issues its still enjoyable filled with bits of frustration .
__label__unhelpful so as i was looking at the main menu i see add server so i looked around set up my own server and just like i thought it is doing nothing when i click add server . also this is lagging on a i <num> <num> th gen intel cpu with <num> gb of ram and <num> gb ddr <num> gpu <num> . <num> mind you it is the only thing that was running and not in multi player . this is going to need a lot of work before it hits the full version . the only reason i got this was the fact i get it for free because i have the pc version of mc . otherwise do not waste any cash on this app yet ! i feel the project was rushed and is a bad name for mine craft all together .
__label__unhelpful this game is one of the best games ive played in quite a while and its not even finished i genuinely cant wait for its full free release in <num> .
__label__helpful payed for stw not br yet br gets all the attention
__label__unhelpful pubg is a beast of a survival game
__label__helpful i bought this for the one x despite reading negative reviews saying it was nearly unplayable . i think it runs perfectly fine for an early access game . i’ve disconnected one time and the only time there is lag or frame rate issues is before the match and when you land . i haven’t tried it on the standard xbox one but i have heard the problems are much worse on it . as the game gets updated and optimized this will be a must buy for any fan of the genre and i would recommend it now to any xbox one x owners in a heart beat . in game the only difficulties are learning the controls but a quick view before playing is all i needed to compete but i still have to fine tune some aspects of the controls still . overall i have no regrets about purchasing the game . update : after a recent patch the game runs better than ever on both xbox one and one x . this game is just getting better and better !
__label__helpful any fan of crafting , building and defense games would love this ! would definetly recommend this game ! looks great and plays very well ! two thumbs up <emoji> and a <num> star rating well deserved for a great fun title like this one ! am really enjoying the game . definetly worth paying $ <num> for . <emoji> does not disappoint .
__label__unhelpful a broken game shotgun dmgs glitch and do <num> dmg and loot system is broken
__label__helpful well , this is a great game and all , but it doesnt have all of the things that the java version of minecraft has . and we cannot use mods (at least not yet . )in this version , or texture packs . yeah , sure , this game has bugs in it , thats what is expected from a beta , i get that . i also have one other problem in mind . multiplayer . mabey in the future we could use the minecraft xbox one edition andor minecraft xbox <num> edition servers on minecraft connected to the windows <num> edition of minecraft . isnt that a good idea ? mabey not . hmm . is that all . yup , i guess so . anyways , in conclusion , i think this game is great and all (mabey my ideas will not be included , but who knows ? ) and the fact that it is in beta version ? it is just fantastic . well , keep working on that game , and make us proud (wow , never typed for so long in my life except for school purposes . ) !
__label__helpful this is the best game for our family and we are absolutely enjoying the recent activity on the game . we have <num> pcs and <num> tablets with this game and i would compare this to legos but on steroids . i highly recommend for kids that need to stretch their imaginations !
__label__unhelpful this game is horrible ! you gave my son depression ! you crap load of s <emoji> it on my jimmys screen ! i wasted my money for brain <emoji> washing game ! u have brought my child toshoot others and he says lit when he kills someone irl <emoji>
__label__helpful love the llama update^ <num> ^ game play and love the game should add more animals to the game .
__label__unhelpful a game that gives or makes you : excitement , wonder , anger , anxious , joy , fear , scared , destroyed by loss of good loot ! best mp game changer since arma series
__label__helpful it is good but very overrated a lot and it haves a lot of bugs + the sikns are to expensive <num> $ <num> one
__label__helpful i have been playing this game for awhile now and i have noticed some faults but i have to say they fix it almost every update . besides some weapon issues it is a fantastic game . it has really good graphics , good animations , very realistic .
__label__unhelpful its great , but it crashes after five minutes , i own it on my computer .
__label__helpful i essentially love minecraft . it is an amazing experience to be a part of , and it helps me to calm my nerves . however , i am having a problem with it . it seems to have a crashing problem . i will be building something , then it crashes . when i manage to get back to the world i was building in , my structure has either disappeared of severely downgraded . but , like i said , i essentially love minecraft . theres just that issue .
__label__unhelpful guns are better than fortnite logic , but this game always crash and your up straight in the butthole faggot enjoy <num> th place
__label__unhelpful still a piece of get fortnite instead its free and better than this will ever be
__label__unhelpful graphics are worst then <num> movement is crap doors suck to open waste of <num>
__label__helpful cannot play it on hololens . the progress bar is still rolling
__label__unhelpful this game sucks so much , i hope the creators die by a gunshot to there ugly mf face , pubg is gonna kill this cartoonish game , dont play this game its filled with degenerate nerds who have big gay .
__label__unhelpful i like it but how to turn to creative
__label__helpful good game crashes a little more then most little laggy some rubberbanding but after a few patches and <num> fps this game is the next great thing to the fps genre and is going to put other shooters to bed .
__label__helpful this game is amazing and free . the first day when i started playing it i didnt know that there was skins that you can buy . a couple days later i knew that i needed to get a skin . but instead of buying the skins i bought save the world deluxe edition so i can get vbucks everyday .
__label__unhelpful i like the guns i don , t like the glitch
__label__unhelpful all you do is crash and die you can never win gun fight bc the hit detection is so i could of shot someone in the face with the shotgun and they wouldnt die then you have the crashing you ldgit cant go two games without crashing its horrible the game is a load of actual human feces
__label__helpful my young old drags me into the game once and awhile to play . i always find myself relaxing and having fun . game on !
__label__helpful good job getting this one for us ! crashes a lot . had to bring it down to <num> stars . <num> . <num> . <num> update game is trash man started @ <num> stars now <num> uninstalled
__label__helpful the game is fun at first , but if you even get the slightest hint of competition youll only get mad at the game . meaning itll turn into a game you think youre having fun at but are really putting yourself in hours of repeated pain .
__label__helpful its a good piece of most of the great features of minecraft . i personally feel cheated that you have to pay for resource packs . the lack of the end dimension is ok and i am still waiting for the inclusion of command blocks . other than that its just slightly behind on features and sadly doesnt have the quizconnectivity bug in redstone , but thats ok for the most part with the inclusion of the observer . tl : dr=ok , but some stuff missing or not as good .
__label__helpful this game is fun addictive and challenging which keeps me coming back for more . ive been playing since day one and this game continues to improve . downside is the bad servers and constant outages and maintenance , trolls , and team killing . overall its worth the buy .
__label__helpful framerate needs improvement , aim needs alot of fine tuning . even pc players that can run this on ultra settings dont because its easier to see players with foilage set to very low and other settings on medium . after playing with inventory system i can say it works but not as fast as drag and drop . rubberbanding after jumping out the plane and after landing is there and an all too familiar issue from pc . vaulting is a great addition , some new guns are nice . since this is early access i will be continuing to play since playing on pc bluehole has always been updating the game at a steady pace . if your a first timer to this game then it will be a bad first impression . for people like myself who played on pc , this is what we dealt with on that early access launch . overall the game is fun but lots of optimization is ahead of us .
__label__unhelpful i like it because its very addictive game and have a good graphics but i want it to be free because i already purchase the android edition
__label__helpful it cured my cancer and depression but then it gave me more depression then it cured my depression but then i developed cancer on all my body parts i watched everry anime in history and it cured my cancer but then john wick gave my depression back the end
__label__unhelpful game is fun for <num> day then its just me landing and dying . do not waste time to download . also the only way to get vbucks is to pay for them which is over priced or pay a stupid amount for an add on save the world . game abselute crap
__label__helpful this is a game preview ! it will have bugs . it will crash . they are working and updating to make it better . dont get mad when you pay for a game preview and it crashes . be supportive , and understanding . if you encounter errors , go to their forums and let them know the issues you have . leaving <num> star reviews just because it crashed is childish . rate on the gameplay and the fun you have while it is working . think of this as an alpha test , just open to whomever supports them by buying the game preview . the gameplay is fun . love the option to run around in vehicles , grab backpacks to carry more , and being able to loot other players . if your in a squad , a microphone is highly recommended . i have had alot of fun with random people , even with the game crashing for them and me . alot of times you can load right back into the match , and if you have a good squad to keep you alive , get right back into the action . i am excited and cant wait to see their finished project . <num> stars ! keep it up ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful but , there should be a map preference option . the newer maps are more open and made more for sniping . not everyone is good at itprefers it . puts people at a disadvatage . also for those who want better performance get a pc . xbox one x is just a slightly better s .
__label__helpful it would be better if they did more but thats impossible because tons of youtubers are playing this game and not talking about any of the problems .
__label__helpful how am i supposed to get <num> chest from wailing woods if the game dosent guarantee the one chest that spawns their , and fight between the other <num> people who land in a microscopic hut , again <num> times , the games trash , dont get me started on the lag or how people manage to pull out their glider right as they land , or how people shoot through <num> different walls while im trying to heal , or how gernades from grease grove reach me from tiled , thx epic fix your game , or the challenge choose
__label__helpful i just hate how fortnite players are super salty , but pubg is a great game . there are still lag spikes but other than that its great
__label__unhelpful play fortnite . this game has been around forever . battle royale drops out of nowhere and has far less issues . waste of money
__label__helpful this game has the worse deaths than mw <num> . you can put a whole clip into someone with them not taking damage and they can <num> shot you . im not kidding . one of the worst games ive ever played .
__label__unhelpful yes , it has its bugs but that is just a symptom of early access . frames will drop and it takes a bit of time to get the controls down but over all its a great game that will only get better as time goes on . get this game while it is still $ <num> . so much fun and the hype behind it is real . go get the chicken dinner !
__label__unhelpful youre better off downloading and installing the java version
__label__unhelpful princess stamos cant get monopoly property and therefore is a boy
__label__helpful this is an m rated game thats being toned down to suit chinese sensibilities , even though theres no crossplay
__label__unhelpful its like playing a mobile game on console . not worth <num> $ . buggy as hell and not streamline at all . wasted my money .
__label__unhelpful can i just get a refund ? fortnite is so much better . framerate ruins whole experience i cant believe they force you to pay while fortnite is free .
__label__helpful most people on this game are little kids <num> , trolls , and who think that they are better than their team . its not the game , its the players . enjoy :
__label__helpful crashes need fixed . none of these updates have fixed the major issue . even with a x i still get kicked <num> of my games . all these updates and still no fiw ?
__label__unhelpful the devs fixed the crashing issue and have done a lot of updates . def worth it .
__label__unhelpful gameplay is fun . when it works . servers crash ever other day and when they are up your game lobby will crash <num> of the way through . it is nice that when you log back in , not all is lost . no . instead of the rewards earned you get a level <num> chest with booty in it . so many times over . it truly is a huge waste of time .
__label__helpful update : the recent patches have made some large and positive improvements but there is still a ways to go . its nice to see that its headed in the right direction though .
__label__helpful it sucks , dont get . very bad .
__label__helpful this game was good , now there are so many overwhelming updates that the game is getting the gunss are unbalened , and every one has to rely on two shotguns epic games if you are reading this , please listen
__label__unhelpful its a great game but its choppy and laggy more than any game out . the concept is the only thing people like and its the only game of its kind on console so it will keep selling .
__label__unhelpful okay , i still get it is a beta game . but instead of building mechanics off of the xbox ; do it off the pc . or keep it and have the option to boot normal pc . because i get it has to have the same functionality . i do like the convenience of it in live tiles but , i normally play pc and this felt like the dark ages of it . so it would be great if at release , there is a normal version for my mods and normal and pc play . you can only integrate two platforms so much .
__label__helpful i love this game and i cant wait for the jetpacks this is awesome i love this do you
__label__unhelpful stupid game no wonder it is free
__label__unhelpful updated <num> start of april ( <num> months after release) now and it still gets <num> stars . they just keep adding more stuff to the game that no one wants and has no use . they should be fixing prior issues and problems not adding more come on . the gun play is getting better but still just rushers with shotguns <num> of the time . all these rifles and never a chance to use them lol . they also continue to mess up the game every update they put out . <num> step forward <num> steps back . they clearly want money with their overpriced cosmetics . i mean seriously $ <num> $ <num> for just <num> skin ! wow . if epic put more time into solving game issues and not pumping out battle passes and overpriced skins then maybe ill give them more stars . untill then nope .
__label__helpful i love minecraft but this edition needs work . for example there is no server support and the design is from minecraft pocket edition ! please change the layout and please add server support . thanks for listening
__label__helpful these are my favorite types of games . if you are into shooter freeroam games this is for you .
__label__unhelpful fix nameplates . fix fps . fix footsteps .
__label__helpful love how i have to wait <num> minutes after landing for the game to render . by that time everyone has guns and im screwed without any gear . update : the game is even worse now . infinite load screen on the new map , the game is literally unplayable if i get the new map .
__label__helpful i dont like how i hit the guy with <num> bullets and he killed me
__label__unhelpful game is trash . keeps lagging and when it get to <num> people it crashes
__label__unhelpful they said we would be getting new content on a set date and then had to push it back cuz it was not ready . well i already took the day off and canceled my other plans . dont give us set dates unless you are <num> ready to do it on that date . and when you lie to us reward us . if ark lies to us they give double exp for a while and apologize . i deal with the crashes at the last minute of a hour long mission and then when i get back in i get little or no rewards for the mission . i deal with the pay as the only way to get good things . p <num> w . i do not like being lied to and then not rewarded . we didnt force you to give us the date . update jan so i paid <num> plus dollars for this game and now i am forced to wait <num> mins to log in queue because they let a whole bunch of pvpers have the game for free . i am a paying customer i shouldnt have to wait in line with the people who got it free .
__label__helpful first launch was rough but its a preview cant expect much but the game has potential ! with time its going to get better with the delay and lag
__label__helpful i was a bit unsure if the game would run well and so far a solid <num> to <num> fps with some bugs not that much this game exceeded my expectations
__label__unhelpful its all pay to win . im not going to be one of those idiots who waste all of their money on skins . the whole game is formed around micro transactions . and then the community shames people for not wasting their all their money
__label__helpful dont buy this terrible game . this game is boring and i do not recommend it to anyone .
__label__helpful blue balls has the balls to release a mobile game for free that runs better than xbox .
__label__helpful like the gameplay but the game constantly crashes and freezes . if that get fixed i would rate <num> stars . but overall it is an enjoyable game .
__label__unhelpful siege vegas games were super ! this game having no one player storyline is a travesty . too bad multiplayer is ruining most of the series out there .
__label__unhelpful i like theres a thing were u make yur own base and thats it
__label__unhelpful waiting in loading qeue for <num> min
__label__unhelpful cant pause the game . it keeps running , even when im in the esc menu . cant change the resolution . cant use my old save files . everything feels clunky with the keyboard and mouse . it kind of feels like they just ported over the xbox version , where youre supposed to use the controller . it works , but it feels very disconnected from my inputs . theres this weird thing with my view . maybe its a result of the poor (and unchangeable) resolution . the view is either too close , or i get this weird , shimmery , fisheye effect where everything i can focus on is both too sharp and too far away , and everything else is in perpetual motion blur , even if im not moving . it makes me nauseous , and theres no happy medium between the two . all in all , absolutely hate this version .
__label__unhelpful its challenging and all but , the trial is only <num> minites come on thats not long enough
__label__unhelpful im brand new to minecraft . downloaded block story on my tablet and minecraft to win <num> pc . my daughter really enjoys creative mode in minecraft , but we both play survival in block story . few primary reasons : <num> . minecraft does not have any tutorial (quests in block story) . when youre completely new to the game , its hard to figure out whats going on and what youre supposed to be doing without any tutorial . i find it very poor . quests in bs really help you understand the game and send you off on a great adventure . <num> . recipe book is completely missing in minecraft . i find it very handy in block story to explore new tools , weapons , armor options etc to conquer the next level . im completely lost without a recipe book in minecraft . <num> . game controls . especially on the crafting table . for example , separating items from a stack can be a challenge . had no issues in block story , but still am straggling in minecraft . again , tutorial would be very handy . please , think about newbies !
__label__helpful iove it , its a little buggy right now but it did release <num> hours ago .
__label__helpful its a good game but i hate that you have to pay for skins how about unlocking skins or skins in pve who agrees ?
__label__unhelpful best free game on the market . pubg runs terrible and is boring . give this a try with friends and have fun .
__label__helpful inconsistent frame rate and clunky controls dont take away from my enjoyment of this game ! i think with a few updates it will be incredible !
__label__helpful my pastor told me to delete it or satan will enter my body .
__label__helpful its almost exactly like minecraft pocket edition , and i like that . i love the crossplay between the other editions and this edition ! this game is perfect for lowend computers , like mine ! this game is the unified version of the game , and i love it !
__label__unhelpful where is the aquatic update the fish and stuff . why donti have it ! plz : ( im part swedish can you help a brother out ? i would be so much happier with it and i would stop sending you messages . give it to me ! thank you i have it now : )
__label__unhelpful game crashes somewhat consistently . lag and framerate issues . after ten updates it still has a lot of the same problems . update <num> . <num> : i just threw $ <num> at a xbox one x and that seems to fix nothing . game looks prettier though ! <emoji> update <num> . <num> : over the last <num> months ive accrued <num> hours into pubg on xbox . after the full release the game is still the buggiest ive ever experienced on console . constant de sync , lag , and still crashes during gameplay among other things . update <num> . <num> : having problems running squads , constantly having to restart the game . desync and lag in most gunfights still . cars flip or explode for no reason . six more days until blackout arrives and i can delete this broken , frustrating game .
__label__helpful fun game but crashing multiple times a game is not going to cut it . they need to stop that first . dropped to <num> stars bc its not getting better no updates in more than <num> weeks
__label__unhelpful when i download java , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy windows <num> , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy pe , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . when i buy ps <num> , xbox <num> , xbox one and wii and switch it charges me $ <num> , <num> for each download . when i download <num> ds , it charges me $ <num> , <num> . mojang and microsoft , are you trying to steal my money or just be who are walking around being mean ? i do not recommend this stealer game !
__label__unhelpful it be better without the game crashing as soon as i land plus other crucial moments rubberbanding every where !
__label__helpful just look how ark survival started and what it is today huge difference , preview you take the bad with the good if you cant except that then what for full game or you should have waited dumb to complain on unfinished game
__label__helpful i love the idea of being able to play with people if their on the pc or mobile device ! its awesome because my brother doesnt have a well working computer and we can play minecraft together ! but i dont like the fact the when you hit an animal with a pick the pickaxe disappears . hope this update stays , its amazing . really !
__label__helpful ive always preferred pubg for a battle royale experience due to the games emphasis on realism and gearweapon variety rather than it being arcady and cartoony (which is the reason why i dont like fortnite) and overall , ive had a relatively good experience playing this game but however , im not going to deny that this game has some major issues that will surely hurt its reputation . the first and most obvious issue is the frame rate . a match usually starts off with really bad fps that averages at around <num> or so smoothing out a minute after you land on the ground . this can get pretty annoying and can cause one to get killed and lose . the other being the poor latency and crashes . you can be hiding behind a tree , boulder , or a corner of a building and still get shot and every now and then , the game will instantly crash leaving you to be a sitting duck . i get that pubg is in game preview but first impressions matter especially when theyre going against fortnite which is free . <num>
__label__helpful i like this game on the xbox <num> and i love the windows <num> version . it does have problems but that was expected with it in beta . they have made the game way better then when it first came out so i expect it to get even better . and this being a xbox app you can see other peoples screen shots andor videos . making friends is easier then i thought it would be , and playing with friends just makes it better . i would fully recommend this game , even if you found the other versions less then entertaining . im sure you will find this one quite fun and enjoyable .
__label__unhelpful to prove it picture two people ne with a grey ar and one with a blue just installed who would win <num> of the time say something besides the blue ar your wrong
__label__helpful game deserves a low rating . its very overrated . most of the positive reviews are by little kids who havent even started puberty and blindly support a mediocre game , its only popular because it is free . the people who dislike the game get attacked by these who think fortnite is the only game on the planet and immediately assume you are either bad or play pubg . its annoying ! worst of all other games add br because they are begging for more players , thats how fortnite became popular . epic needed to save fortnite , because not many people liked save the world . so epic decided to sap off of pubgs success with br , but this time making it free and advertising it to younger people . thats how fortnite br became popular . those younger people mindlessly defend fortnite with arguments like you just havent gotten a win or you are just a salty pubg fan or even you , you suck i hate you fortnite is the best game ever go kys . i might get bombarded with angry messages for this .
__label__helpful not even remotely ready for early access .
__label__helpful its fun and addictive , but the new update ruined it completely . the game lags way to much and ruins the experience . old fortnite was better .
__label__helpful reasons why i hate it : <num> . bugs <num> . servers are terrible <num> . since you guys brught xbox to the btu update , we wolnt get xbox edition updates . <num> . no mods <num> . its <num> flippin dollars making it more than the java edition even though the java edition is wwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy better . <num> . this is going to be the main version <num> . crashes
__label__helpful (let me just point out this is my first review for a video game)i feel like everyones hating this well made game . (in my opinion anyway)part of it youll notice alot of these reviews are written by alot of younger people and some also dont make any sense . others say its too hard . and others just dont like it which is completely fine . but thats what i think is half of it . ok , enough of that , lets get on with the review . ill start out with the only flaw in my opinion . it can lag alot , it could be my internet though . i had a time when i was in the top <num> (or something like that)and i got teleported to my roof of my base and died . <emoji> some complain about vbucks being too expensive . (which buy emojis , dance moves , skins , etc . ) but , grant no competitive advantage , so it really is a free game . im running out of letters so i got to short this up . on with the good stuff . <num> . no pay to win game . <num> . fun to play . <num> . its sweet to play against <num> players . but only one winner . thanks for reading my opinion . <emoji> ✌
__label__unhelpful i hate it how there forceing you to get the season pass i am done
__label__unhelpful the biggest thing you need to keep in mind is minecraft for pc , the reason people even use it over the xbox or playstation is because of mods . basically we need some form of microsofts approval for modding and possibly an sdk for creating the mods (or something like an api)
__label__helpful crashes every game leaving you a sitting duck if you manage to survive and reload the game its only a matter of time before it crashes again . having <num> instances in a single match is average . i really want to like this game but youre making it impossible .
__label__helpful this is an awesome game for playing for your friends via pc & smartphone . the graphics are nice and crispy , the framerate is at a good <num> fps , and addictive ! so if you have some friends that dont have pc , then i reccommend this software !
__label__helpful i hate this game doesent deserve to be popular online open your eyes the games bad game deserves to die
__label__helpful update : still having a wonderful time ! texture packs would be a definite bonus as well , but for the love of god , implement the <num> d anaglyph already ! previous : (x <num> systems are finally supported ! ) after reading negative reviews , i figured i would install minecraft : windows <num> edition (beta) to test it out . i really dont see what all the fuss is about ! i love this version . its simplified , yet a fully functional version of minecraft : skin packs , servers , nether support , etc . the user interface is clean , and i really enjoy the new features that are integrated into this version . however , it would be nice to see some support for developers who want to publish mods , or some integration for a mod pack store . whether mojang andor microsoft will include this feature is beyond me , but i hope it happens . nonetheless , i sense good things to come in the future . what a fantastic start !
__label__unhelpful could someone please tell me how to download this ? i click install but it keeps saying there is an error . i ended up getting it downloaded now , and it is awesome ! my fault !
__label__helpful the battle royale can die in a fire , i rather play the simpsons wrestling on ps <num> !
__label__helpful just wondering when my velvet couch is going to arrive . i ordered it off this site about <num> weeks ago , and yet nothing has shownup at my door . the problem is that i plan on giving it to my uncle who is in an iron lung . but his anorexic son keeps rubbing my virgin olive oil all over my current furnishings . if this doesnt arrive by next week , my downs lesbian daughter (aka slave) will get her peyton mannings rubbed by a jew who supports nazi germany . much love leprosy boiz (ps . where my hitler at doe ? )
__label__unhelpful just a downgraded version of minecraft pc . there is already a mobile version (pe) and a pc version of the game . whats the point of this ?
__label__helpful its very enjoyable and it runs smoothly with windows <num> and doesnt really freeze as much as it would on a different computer . thnx and i love it
__label__unhelpful i love fortnite <emoji> ifeel like a pro player
__label__helpful okay , fortnite needs an update . the game kinda sucks ! for example , when you build something , you or an enemy sometimes can go through it ! its horrible when youre trying to have a build battle with someone . there is not many benefits , so you suck epic ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i open the game(it freezes for about <num> sec) then i see couple options . i click on play expecting it to take me to the create world screen . except the game freezes . i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that doesnt work . i tried everything but it still does not work .
__label__helpful terribad trash game . waste of zero dollars .
__label__unhelpful i pretty much thought this game would be kinda fun to play after i played it for like an hour it sucked dick the map is too small its a pubg rip off and theres too many players in the match the guns are just horrible there just for tryhards and you cant even pick what you want your character to look like every players a dick and thats pretty much it from the game is a piece of and i hate it plus , you have to buy one the modes like what the hell are you angry money bastard so , please kill yourself & delete this game while youre at it you fag gut
__label__helpful if youre looking for a tactical shooting game like me , this game is good for you . you need to be cautious because <num> shots and youre a goner . very realistic when it comes to break ins and you need a strong sense of team work . one flaw is the server and the slight toxic community . thanks <num> reading
__label__unhelpful the control scheme is lousy . skins need to be bought . ive played the original pc version since it was in beta , and the controls work so much better . this is just the mobile version with a new title . not to mention the microtransactions . leave it to microsoft to ruin a great game . dont get me wrong , this is brilliant if you are playing on a phone , but , as a pc version , this is terribly tedious . the only reason i give it two stars is because it is very well optimized for a beta . little to no lag . if the controls were like pc with this level of optimization , <num> . if , on top of that , you take away any microtransactions , it would be <num> easy . as of now , it is just microsoft trying to make a quick buck . sorry mojang . you shouldnt have to suffer for them .
__label__helpful first of all stop complaining about how the second season pass is a rip off all it does is give stuff you can earn . then this game is not repitive omg i know right its hard to believe but its not , you have to trust me here ! finally it is a alot of fun especially with friends and the community is asome like if you played seige you have to know lord tachancka .
__label__unhelpful this version is basically a version of minecraft with less features , and costs money to install texture packs . each texture pack costs a ridiculous amount , while you could just do some searching on planetminecraft and find a texture pack that is basically the same as the ones offered in these iaps , and download it for free . the add ons are basically like community maps with adventures , but there are so many good maps that already exist on planetminecraft and other sites that you can just download and install to the full version . there really arent that many redeeming features to this version , if at all .
__label__helpful this game has so many issues ! if its not the consant lag or glitching you need to worry about this game kicking you from gameplay ! not to mention that the aiming and bullet projectory are all over the place ! out of all the betaspreviews ive ever played this is by far the worst ! if these issues arent fixed and soon , this game will push every gamer experiencing these exact issues away permanently . ive greatly enjoyed playing this game when everything is working (which is becoming rare) so im hoping these issues become resolved in a quick manner . truly hoping the best for this game but if nothing gets fixed i guarantee that this game will lose a lot of people that looked forward to playing it but have now became just as frustrated and disappointed as i have since first playing this game . <num> just got kicked in middle of gameplay ! how about you all at pubg fix this issue instead of creating new maps ! get your together !
__label__helpful take the cartoony monsters of pvz , add in the epic weapons and feel of borderlands , and throw in the crafting open world feel of <num> days ; and you get this action packed thrill of a game !
__label__helpful its just way too laggy and poorly optimized . yes i understand the game is in preview , but it seems like the devs dont even care anymore . everytime i get near someone , i start rubberbanding and as a result the person kills me before i can even shoot back . i dont experience networkserver lag on any other multiplayer game , so its definitely not my internet , its these terrible pubg servers . update : the latest update on july <num> th , <num> has literally just broke the game . it will crash every time i try joining a match . so yeah , this is not worth the $ <num> . save up for a pc and buy pubg there . then itll be worth it .
__label__unhelpful with minimum microtransactions consistent updates fortnite is free to play if you chose but skill gap is a problem personally but practice makes perfect
__label__helpful sometimes for some reason my entire creative menu just disappears for some random reason and stays gone for hours sometimes . it also crashes a lot more often too . however it is very fun to play as well . i just wish that you would add the dualwielding for weapons and include shields as well . i would also appreciate if you could please add a legitimate hardcore mode and if that would happen i would rate minecrfat windows <num> edition (if i could) <num> + stars . the gameplay is amazing , millions of people have downloaded it and enjoyed having a good time on solo missions and with their friends . i would also appreciate if you would add armor stands and also a spectator mode as well . to sum it up now : the new update has some glitches so please fix that , please add shields and a proper dualwielding system along with a hardcore mode , and lastly its just a great game in general . i would also appreciate if you would reply to comment and tell me what the new update will have so thanks !
__label__helpful you should fix the way we customize our characters . for ex i pressed a button thinking i was choosing a style , instead im stuck with the basic looking character
__label__unhelpful i love the game and i play it but i think its way overpriced for an app . i wish it was either free or $ <num> . <num> because that seems fair .
__label__helpful it is fun and not too challenging for the normal missions . however , the storm sheild missions are nearly impossible alone , and it is a real grind to get the materials needed for defenses , defenders , and bullets . it just really needs solo balance , but besides that it is a great game .
__label__unhelpful awesome solo duo or squad based game , some minor kinks but the fun outways them all . definitely worth the <num> gb space on your harddrive . forget fortnite and get your real chicken dinner <emoji> <emoji>
__label__helpful skill tree buggy pve side
__label__helpful okay so i have been playing this game for a year and a half and after i did the recent update it stopped working i can get to the main menu but every time i press the start button and it starts to load the stuff it just goes back to the xbox home menu its a really fun game and the only option i have is to uninstall and reintall it and if that works ill change to <num> but if it doesnt you wont see an update to this post
__label__helpful i love how there is now a minecraft where i can play with friend over xbox live . what i dont like , is how there arent a lot of updates coming out ; would you please launch some more updates so i can play a more current version with my friends , please ? i am a big fan of minecraft , and this is a good way to play with friends , without paying for realms every <num> + months (note : the earlier versions of minecraft : windows <num> edition beta balances it all out) . all in all , i love the <num> edition beta , and good job and keep up the good work ! from my house to the microsoft hq , thank you for the work , and keep going . ps : randomly , my windows button andor game menu randomly comes up . this could be just be me , but who knows , right ? please fix this somehow .
__label__helpful if you can get over the game crashing every match , network lag at the worst possible time , and horrid frame rates , all that will result in your demise , the game would be fun . if youre expecting any sort of playable game , look elsewhere . loot boxes double each time you purchase them , the rng is horrid . ive opened over a dozen boxes and recived the same two pairs of pants four times . id seriously wait a year or two until this game is playable before spending any money on it . dont even get me started on the graphics .
__label__helpful avoid at all costs , crashes multiple times back to back dont waste your money
__label__unhelpful im in gold and i get put agaisnt plats wtf
__label__unhelpful once pubg comes to xbox one this game will die
__label__helpful this game is clunky and feels gross . really poorly done . stick to fortnite
__label__helpful take this one star of censorship and shove it up your chinese bowing as . this is a mature rated game depicting combat and you want to teenify it by removing blood , skulls , and gambling references to appease xi jingpei ? just wait until western folks vote with their wallets and you start feeling it like ea has . now go choke on some yuan , scumbags . youll not see another cent from me again .
__label__unhelpful this game is boring and based on luck . it gets on my nerves you shoulda put out save the world first . you developers need to work on stw more or this game will become pure ! im waiting (still) for save the world to be available for free for now <emoji> this game <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the game is ok if youre a kid with a lot of free time . sadly , losing everything on death and without a way to easy transport the character to different positions in the world makes the game unlikely for a busy adult .
__label__helpful hi my name is capitao and my nose is flatter than a side walk eam kill me so that y nose can get normal plz help if you dont auschwitc is coming to town
__label__unhelpful its pubg time ! rawr xd
__label__helpful this game is fun . and a grind . but mostly , its a buggy laggy glitchy mess . not to mention they reset our permanent bases today without warning . wait for free to play .
__label__unhelpful do not get this game . it is pay to win and you will alway get instantly killed by someone with a shotgun or by a sniper you will never see .
__label__helpful i love the flow of the game and how tactical it like csgo
__label__helpful this game is awesome to play with friends only issue is when you dont have <num> th player itll take some time to start .
__label__helpful you guys didnt put lot of effort in thiss people arehacking and you guys arent doin anything about it and need to make updates twice a week
__label__helpful can it stop crashing on season <num>
__label__unhelpful this game is fun but it could be better if i didnt go aginst teamers and try hard that will do anything to kill you if you could have people with epic accounts have skill matched players . most of the time i have played with starters who get insta killed in the start an also some new items are just random another way ou could fix the game if you make playground have more players like <num> so people can practice also i have been in alot of games where people team but dont get banned also this game is a scam
__label__unhelpful all u do is defend an atlas and this guys van . its terrible and doesnt deserve <num> . <num> whatsoever
__label__unhelpful java edition is what you want ! you cant even mod on this ! absolutely terrible !
__label__helpful i love the adventure and the combat . the building is very enjoyable . i fell in love with this game if it may be fate
__label__helpful glitches and lag are horrible . i black screen and lag out every <num> games . it lags for the first <num> minutes of every game . i have multiple game clips where i start to walk up stairs and they disappear and then reappear . then im stuck in the stairs and it kills me . thats a great way to start a squad match . if they ever fix these issues it will be as fun as it is on pc . but until they fix the problems , it is unplayable at this point . i know it is a work in progress but you shouldnt charge for a game that is unplayable . needs a major update .
__label__unhelpful the game in itself is good , but it gets <num> much credit . the game has lag issues plus the whole game is <num> luck based . theres not much skill when someone has a purple ar that ends u in <num> shot compared <num> a green peashooter ar that takes <num> headshots <num> gun somebody down . plus the mapchest weapon drops r <num> consistent in some areas . there r plenty of skilled players in the game but almost everyone knows where the best loot chest r on the map . it makes the game <num> uneven . plus , this game is a squeaker paradise <emoji> .
__label__helpful but the only thing i want is to cross play with xbox one players if the game gets updated to that point , but would really like to see that and experience it and play it . now the game itself is simply the best way faster then the regular one and thats because its meant to be like that just please put to where you can play with xbox users even though pc is kind of better controls then regular xbox controller but still please add it to that . thank you !
__label__unhelpful you will almost spend more time updating than you will be playing because it is constantly needing updated ! now im almost out of data .
__label__helpful works for me ! great game !
__label__helpful this game is the epitome of gets old fast . oh and micro transactions . nuff said
__label__helpful this version of mc really helps to test out the newly introduced addons and to test a bunch of maps that require a set of power and speed .
__label__unhelpful keeps logging me out in the middle of matches . this game is trash
__label__helpful i want my money back plus an extra <num> for playing ths junky game its getting worse each update not better
__label__unhelpful i have lots of time in on this game . from the start of pc and xbox . they fix the game and then patch it broken in <num> days . they dislike your input so dont waste your time . buy the game , its worth $ <num> . dont get your hopes up . <num> years in now and they are still letting us down .
__label__helpful pure piece of . if u play this game idk how u sleep at night , not all its hype to be
__label__unhelpful pvp : rng bullets ruins pvp . where do my bullets go ? pve : the lag is really bad at times , you can tell epic games is putting their effort in pvp only . we should call it paragon . skilled base players stay clear
__label__unhelpful they said that on <num> save the will be for free but its a lie
__label__helpful this is the most played game on my pc and it is amazing . i love this game and the updates are constant to this game so you wont be left in the cold . this is the best ten dollars that i have ever spent period .
__label__unhelpful stop fixing all the farms we create dang it . it supper annoying to see hundreds of hours and players farms stop working so not cool . missing the note block still plz add it
__label__helpful i play this game every day and can say that this has to be one of the best competitive games out there , right next to rb <num> s . <emoji>
__label__helpful ok guys , so i see a lot of misinformed reviewers that would like this game a lot better if they knew more about their problems . so , if anyone has questions , just head your review jessicamac and i will try and answer via my review . each answer will only be up for <num> hours , so if you dont see a response you might have missed your answer or i could have missed your question . i do my best but nobodys perfect . : ) im a real person that playz this game , and ive read a lot on the subject , so i can probably help , but check me with google if you want . let me know if im misinformed ! i could notknow something about the best game on the planet ! lol . sooooooo i cant wait to see if i can help you out . jess btw , my review is an obvious <num> star , but im not an advertiser , so i dont plan on blowing up or anything if you happen to hate minecraft or something . ; ) i just want to make sure youre fully informed before you start hating ! posted <num> : <num> am saturday i will post info on public servers .
__label__helpful here is a rundown of he typical fortnite game , you first chose whether you want to have fun or get a victory royal . (play aggressive or passive) and then get over the fact that <num> of the playerbase will make hackusations if you win with a default character . on another note , the useless microtransactions are strong in this game . im sure weve all learned by now that cosmetics = skill , right ? anyway after effortessly clearing the drop area its only a matter of time untill someone snipes you from halfway aross the circle and you sit there wondering why this game is so popular , or die as soon as you land , thinking the same damn thing . and winning is just boring . you sit in the circle and wait . forever . untill there are <num> people in a space ⅓ the size of an american football field and pick them off with some random legendary weapon . all in all , fortnite isnt terrible just mediocre . dont waste any of your <num> tb worth of space on it .
__label__helpful it is a watered down version of pubg .
__label__helpful i love this version of the game , its very stable and fast . but the ui still sucks . i think the ui needs just a bit more polish . also just a ton of little things from the java edition would make the game that much better .
__label__helpful this is a great game everyone should play it
__label__helpful super tight controls . sick textures and sound . super addictive , not rinse and repeat like cod . balanced gameplay . varied levels . you are a must own tom .
__label__helpful its a really neat game .
__label__unhelpful it is so fun i do not want pubg to sue epic games . if they do will we get are money back and i want epic games to updating the game because it is so friken fun .
__label__helpful just a little lag and a few crashes , im sure it will get solved . graphics take alittle while to load but it is still fun . could use more vehicle spawns , find myself running a long time and never a car in sight . im sure everything will get better with a little time .
__label__helpful this is still beta and thus not at all a finished product . its amount of content is far from the actual java pc version but i hope thats going to come more or less soon . great to see a pc version of minecraft without java , though . surprise , surprise , it runs a whole lot quicker than the java version and im glad this step has finally been taken . other things id like to have improved are the actual pc controls . key remapping should be there and the current camera controls with the mouse are way too quick and feel weirdly accelerated . also , my scroll wheel is way to sensitive on this game . i am aware it has to do with logitechs smooth scrolling feature but most games are fine with it and it would be great if this minecraft version could have a fix as well . anyway , curious as to how this will turn out .
__label__helpful if u turn off game dvr under settings>preferences>capturing and broadcasting you will notice a gigantic increase in the consistency of your framerate and will notice less crashes . you do lose the availability to stream and record but i think its worth the trade . try it out !
__label__unhelpful i dont like the fact you require xbox live to play , on ps <num> you only require internet . microsoft is trying to be greedy and make more money (not like they dont have billions . )
__label__unhelpful super fun and addicting all the <num> star reviews are frigging cry babies . games unfinished they most likely suck and expect instant gratification or a participation trophy like most whine millennials . its <num> everyones a critic and offended by anything and everything lets see you whiners make a better game . you wont smdh .
__label__unhelpful i really like it , but i think the pc version is definitely better , and i know many will agree . you cant download skins or log in with a mojang account . plus , there are no servers ! still an addicting game nonetheless .
__label__helpful its good for kids and is just perfect !
__label__helpful the constant effort being put in by mojang and microsoft to bring constant updates is awesome ! bugfixes and cool new features ! love how little memory and processing power it takes to run the game . i am definitely going to be playing this a lot more often !
__label__helpful after the various bug fixes i can now finally play the game without all the crashes . although the realms are super expensive (please , please microsoft lower the price it kills) they are really fun if you have a lot of friends that dont grief and are a good concept but i wish is was more like , i buy the server for say $ <num> , then to change the world its like $ <num> and i can play for however long i wish on that $ <num> world until i want to pay for a world switch . not to mention if they changed the realm system then they would have a better chance to make more money because parents arent going to pay $ <num> a month forever but they would pay $ <num> if it indeed lasted forever which i think would make more money for microsoft and keep the community happy . dearly , a nerd who has stupid ideas .
__label__helpful this game has been out for a few months now with around a dozen updates and i must say that from the day one release till now the gameplay has improved from crashes to all around weapon and inventory ui (user interface) . ive noticed it even on my o . g . xbox the frames and render distance are near the same wether the <num> x peeps like it or not look up comparisons lol . i recommend it to anyone who wants a more engaging shooter like fortnite with more weapons and customizations for them , just dont expect aaa performance because even though they are both made with ue <num> pubg is more cpu intensive than fortnite with all the vehicles and explosions happening . if you dont like playing a game as a beta tester almost and giving feedback to the developers to help improve the game in the future this might not be your game .
__label__helpful this game is awsome ive been playing sice the start i hope it will keep being popular <emoji> ✌ <emoji> !
__label__helpful with the game still in beta $ <num> is the only buy . the game is fun , but over hyped also . the more i played the game the more i enjoyed it . the game has some good qualitys like a huge skill tree and depth in squads an character building an actual building . at the same time feels like it was all wasted when you get into the game itself . the quest rotate every few hrs or so , same quest just different locations . they throw in daily challenges , trials to help but are still played on these same maps . its not till levels <num> when you first see new locations in the game , they do add a few new enemies as you progress . just with all that depht the gameplay itself falls short filled with repetition an a lot of grinding with drops that you dont need an looking for the ones u do need for crafting . you basically replay the same maps over & over again just rotated . the campaign is just that with breaks of objectives that need to be done on these same maps just rotated locations an mixed in .
__label__helpful i know its in preview but this game is an absolute mess . doesnt run smooth at all and the controls are wonky to say the least . not even the one x can save this game . locked at <num> fps with all kinds of textures popping in and out .
__label__unhelpful i redeemed the code on my pc to use on my kids pc and it would not allow me to do so , so now they cant even play it .
__label__unhelpful i like everything i dont like they dont have cars please add cars !
__label__helpful enjoying the new updates . my daughter requests a rideable unicorn !
__label__helpful save the world give it , insted of giving us ne guns in battle royal give us save the world for free plz !
__label__helpful i would give it a <num> but i bought alot of vbucks but dont have cross platform also xbox should get free skins and picaxes and please fix double pump if you do i will love it
__label__helpful great ed movie love strong kkk presense with blacks totured <emoji> my migos are including mowing lawns teacheskids that women cant vote good vorempreg to this every night with my paided for wifes of the <num> and a half <num>
__label__helpful good fps i enjoy playing it . but whats really annoys me (and many others) is when playing in ranked matches and you happen to lag out , the game will give you temp ban .
__label__unhelpful todos se la pasan corriendo , te disparan cuando acabas de aparecer desde las ventanas o puertas , se salen del edificio o casa para matarte , jugar de esa forma según es de pros y según es jugar de forma competitiva , este juego dejo de ser táctico <num> meses despues de su estreno , ahora es un shooter del monton . no lo compren , se terminaran hartando de los jugadores toxicos .
__label__unhelpful the frame rate is terrible , the lag makes it unplayable . attempting to get a refund .
__label__helpful i like minecraft and i like my new update
__label__unhelpful hi my fortnite dont work
__label__unhelpful been able to play the game until the update came out . enjoyed every bit of it until then . now that the update came out the update will not get past . <num> kb of the update . waited for over <num> hours and no progress please help .
__label__unhelpful from worst to insanely terrible to their getaway update . they now have you getting rid of an item and make you grab the weapon instead of swapping , most of the weapons still suck , and the goddamn getaway mode ! it puts you in a smaller space and then you have to reach in the goddamn back of the goddamn van ! ladies and gentlemen , this has been crowned as the worst and broken br game in history . they shouldve stuck with the jackrabbit .
__label__unhelpful second update . still cant log in after <num> weeks of owning nor can the servers access my purchased content . i cant believe i paid for ths game . stay away ! ive had this game since launch and this is the second time i havent been able to play a game that i paid a lot of money for ! this is not good . seems like their servers are constantly down . it wont log me into my epic account despite the fact ive already played this game a few times . this is garbage .
__label__helpful i like how you can drive vehicles and get all these great guns and stuff but you should be able to drive the big trucks and plzzzz fix the lag . plzzzz add sand map .
__label__helpful good game . only time can make it better .
__label__helpful its a really good gamemode and if u dnt have money for pubg boom battle royale
__label__helpful not quite as good as the pc version , but thats to be expected . what i use this for instead is when im playing with my partner and stepson on their android tablet and ipad . it allows crossplatform local multiplayer from windows <num> to both of those mobile oses . great ! thank you for making this available .
__label__unhelpful anyone who says this game is boring doesnt have enough intelligence to completely rock this game . its not just tower defend missions . this game has more game modes than overwatch . each map load contains different terrain which gives some really interesting defend builds . this keeps you on your crafting toes . if you play just five hours , than you still havent learned everything yet . honestly you were probably in the tutorial but you thought you were playing the game . i completed chapter <num> , which is huge , and get rewarded with more game types . makes me wonder if there will be even more to come to truly challenge the player on final chapter .
__label__helpful epic we dont need more guns we need better servers to handle your growing number of players .
__label__unhelpful there is never an update button there need to be one ro i can never play this again with out fun . we neeeeeeed the update button . like really neeed the update button . oh never mind i found it thank you for the game < <num> < <num> < <num> .
__label__helpful like : the fact that im still alive dislike : the fact i played it
__label__helpful it is fun if you no the right tactics
__label__helpful a great and easy way to play with friends in different places , while it did take me some time to figure it out it was super fun to play with friends in our own homes .
__label__unhelpful getting better , but still has so many annoying problems
__label__helpful i get error code <num> x <num> f <num> and it says try installing again
__label__unhelpful f is for friends who play with you . u is for u are steve n is for
__label__helpful totally fun game for all ages , gives a challenge when wanted so you can see what level you want your monsters to be on or if you want any monsters . super fun game for all ages and cant wait or them to add horses .
__label__helpful i am so happy there are all these updates ! minecraft pewindows <num> is so much more fun and interesting . i am so grateful for all the new features !
__label__helpful updated : lag still prevalent , dcs dont happen as often . hit reg is bad , some games it works , roll of the dice really . still wouldnt recommend this <num> any <num> . with as long as pubg has been a thing and with as many units as its sold , youd think these issues would be sorted , not the case <num> consoles , and to a lesser extent pc .
__label__unhelpful (edit : gameroffaith <num> pls read carefully b <num> u send me comments again . nowhere in this rant did i say fortnight stole the battle royale genre from pubg . pubg didnt invent that genre h <num> z <num> did . ) drop in spawn , eye of the storm ? pubg u just gonna let a rich company that came up with the unreal engine and gears of war screw u by dropping their game first on console and for free , loaded with microtransactions ? lawsuit is surely needed . for those <num> yr old to <num> yr olds who force there parents to support this free to play garbage foff . this is a careless ripoff of what pubg has founded not the battle royale genre but the drop in spawn and the forced movement of the eye of the storm . sad to see a rich huge company like epic games result to stealing ideas from at the time a indie company , but sadder to see people back this stealing from a much smaller francise ! this cant be supported by gamers . u r helping a rich company fattin their pockets by screwing the little guy . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the button layout is not user friendly . the movement is just super clucky . i was very excited for this game . now im just disatisfied . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful we need more time it and it takes too long to land fix <emoji>
__label__helpful i hate how theres teamkillers that have no life i go to ranked they kill me then i my rank goes down its not fair but other than that the game is really good ps : teamkillers go play cod hardcore you will like it
__label__helpful dont get fortnite it sucks get this
__label__unhelpful this game has given me hours of fun and as a free game thats amazing . its good to have a game that all of my freinds can have easy access to and can play together . feels like im back in hs when we use to all play games together more often . with full cross platform , i can finally play with all of my friends no matter what platform they are playing on . thank you epic games !
__label__helpful south african servers would be nice
__label__unhelpful has a very similar layout to the original pc edition , and it is compatible with pe . i can now play on my laptop with people on tablets . thank you ! there are only a few bugs i have noticed so far . i cannot activate nether portals except for flat worlds , once i turned off xbox live multiplayer , i cannot turn it back on . also , an offline mode should be added so i can play when i am not connected to a wifi network other than that , this is a job well done !
__label__unhelpful all i hear is static buzzing on my surface <num> . could be a problem with the app or windows <num> , or even the surface <num> . everything else works okay . would like to be able to modify more options and bring the cursor mode for tablet . and no fps lock would be awesome .
__label__unhelpful <num> stars at best as is . it will get smoother im sure but ffs . first game <num> minutes in i jump some barrels and got squished between them and the fence , which instakilled me lol .
__label__unhelpful this game is garbage it supposed to be so big and the best game but you cant play it with new update there never good loot and the players are hackers fix your epic this game is trash
__label__helpful it is very challenging and fun . i really like the addon features , it gives the game a little more variety !
__label__helpful as far as content is concerned , this port of minecraft is interoperable with the pocket edition (unless youre running a version of pe older than ~ <num> . <num> ) . because its written in c++ , this version of minecraft runs quite smoothly on old <num> st generation i <num> cpus (like the <num> m) and even older core <num> duo cpus . ive even gotten good results on an atom cpu in a stream <num> tablet by hp . id like to see this kind of performance in a version that would interoperate with the javabased minecraft . all that said , its pretty rocksolid for a beta and i havent encountered any glitches or erratic behavior to speak of other than one where the game displays the mojang splash screen and then it quits without giving any error message on my dell e <num> laptop running windows <num> x <num> (even after a clean reinstall) . aside from that , i have no complaints and my only request is the ability to have parity with the java version & the ability to connect to servers .
__label__helpful inconsistent damage trash building trash gameplay for as many updates this game gets its still worse than pubg
__label__helpful i like this game a lot it is challenging and fun at the same time this isthe typee of game that i would love to play in my free time .
__label__unhelpful was a great game , updated to the new windows <num> version and guess what , damn thing wont even start . reason i updated in the first place was because of the cross platform play for the kids , turns out it they charge you monthly for that and the use of the term cross platform is misleading at best . yet another ms fail .
__label__helpful i like it a lot ! but i just wish it were the computer version with the <num> . <num> update and where you can add sever addresses . although is fun , addicting , and fairly awesome , i wish it was what i was expecting <emoji> other than that , this is just an epic game ! if you fix this and update minecraft , i will automatically change my rating to a five star !
__label__helpful im loving the game . aside for the occasional lag here and there . also i dont really like how slow you earn battle points , and how much bp it takes to change how you look . also please lower the bp needed to get a reward crate . its <num> , <num> just to get one now . leave it at like <num> , <num> . but other than that , solid game . please hurry up with the update so theres less lag and more maps . lol .
__label__helpful this version , while it has less content than the original minecraft , runs much better than its previous counterpart . despite the lack of modding support , and the fact that it is essentially minecraft pocket edition on a computer , for people that dont have strong computers (like me) and cant run the original minecraft , this version is much more likely to be able to run at full speed .
__label__unhelpful awesome ! has all the new things . but i cant figure out how to tame a ocelot , fly , stop flying , stop a flood , and all that other complicated stuff .
__label__unhelpful this game is so bad that is a ripoff of pubg one game i got tea baged . this is a hateful game .
__label__unhelpful can you put a main menu at creative mode and we cant open chest and crafting table you update we can have main menu and open anything that you want in creative mod . hey and one more thing mojang , theis version of minecraft needs to be same as the original minecraft . and can you help me add the mocreatures mod to my minecraft cause is no fun having so less animals
__label__helpful this game is good ! very addicting ! many of operaters , guns , and more to unlock ! its bassically attack and defend . like addicting games youll be attatched to ! then get this game !
__label__helpful i wouldve given for fortnite , <num> stars , but it has good game play , but its way too . luck based it has way too much which isnt a game its very hard to win when theres so many glitches were you cant shoot the gun and where you fall to your death after usinsing your glider also its annoying when somebody shoots a door kills you while its the door and go through it and kills you
__label__helpful it is a great game for windows <num> . its also awesome that you can cross platforms and be able to join pocket edition on either ios or android . the game would be <num> times better if you make it like either the pc version or slowly make it up to the xbox and playstation version . adding commands would also bump up buyers . thank you ! update ( <num> ) everything is perfect and finally added everything i could ask for now the best portable minecraft ever ! thank you mojang !
__label__helpful i know im not the first to say this , but this reminds me of when i played minecraft before all of the fancy updates and multiplayer came out . its managed to capture that feeling of intense planning combined with long stretches of peaceful creation .
__label__unhelpful i love minecraft but . they couldve added more detail and animals like leaves swaying and have other animals like goats , snakes , maybe butterflies , crocodiles , or deer even .
__label__helpful i lovee this game but i wish save the world was free <emoji>
__label__helpful is the game good ? yes . it has bugs so what all games do , name <num> game that doesnt any . yeah the game is hard because its realistic . dont give a game a bed rep over bugs . ive been playing since day <num> and have seen big improvement , i havent had a crash in months ang lag is minimal and kept to when the map renders . guns are balanced and strat is everything . dont pass a game that is bad for you because someone else is better . give it a fair shot before passing judgement .
__label__helpful great game cant wait for the redstone to come in
__label__helpful i have spent many hours playing and enjoying pubg . that being said this is not a finished game and should not be advertised as such . there are lots of bugs that make this game extremely frustrating , little things that should have been fixed before <num> . <num> . all of these bugs i can except but what i am most upset about is the fact they decided to put full product release in the title . how dumb do you think we are pubg or should i say pubgfpr . you pushed it out to try and make quick buck before big title games came out . it makes me sad that a game i love doesnt have the decency to let me put on some lipstick before i get . im insulted and every one who still plays this game should be to . if you want to say your game is finished , fine just have it say playerunknowns battlegrounds . that will imply the games done . fire your marketing person and hire some more devs . dont give up on your game !
__label__unhelpful this game is not fun and a waste of space . the only reason im rating one star is because i cant rate zero stars !
__label__unhelpful think you could add any more confusing menus , charts , webs and currencies ? update <num> . the introduction of the battle royale mode has considerably increased the playability of this game . the original game playing against zombies is still crap .
__label__helpful awesome game . but it doesnt start anymore
__label__helpful i like the variety of unique characters
__label__helpful well , i think what should be in the <num> . <num> . <num> . <num> . <num> , mojang needs to add elytras , polar bears and the same thing the pc version to make mcpe , mc , and minecraft console edition to be more like the same , or just keep adding new items one by one , for example , the pc version doesnt have the observer in the <num> . <num> . <num> . <num> . <num> update of mcpe , i know that on android , mcpe has builds (for example , <num> . <num> . <num> build <num> , <num> . <num> . <num> wasnt finished when the build was released , but apple doesnt , they only get official <num> . <num> . <num> before <num> . <num> . <num> come out for new items or various bug fixes . i hope minecraft gets a little more creative in new update . i wait and wait for an update , but its not there for me , so i have the builds if no update , i hope someone comment about this saying that mojang needs to make new items in new updates like pc does , pc gets lots of items added than mcpe . but i still love this game , i used to have blocklauncher but it doesnt have a update , so i switched to mcpe master , its fun ! so plz enjoy
__label__helpful when can we transfer our xbox worlds to pc , or mcpe viseversa ? without realms :
__label__unhelpful as someone whos played minecraft for pc since it was in beta (the java version) , im not quite sure how i feel about this game . when this was first released , it was pe all over again , and something i wouldnt have wanted to play . now though , this and pe have been advanced leaps and bounds over what they were a year ago , and to my knowledge , this game has suddenly gotten a lot of what was missing before . that said , its still unmoddable and continues to be behind the java counterpart for releases . since im reviewing on a pc with a mouse and keyboard , my review might be biased , but i think this app is a waste for pc users . if youre using a surface on the go or a w <num> phone , this app is the only way youll be able to play , at which point i recommend getting it . if youre a pc user , i would recommend investing more into the java version at minecraft . net .
__label__helpful the game has a good community and is mostly fun . when it comes to matchmaking , ranked is fun with a squad and so is casual but if you decide to play with randoms , seven out of ten times your team is brain dead and the other team is full of diamond ranked players . i have been playing this game for about a year and think the game and even season pass were worth the buy .
__label__unhelpful performance is terrible , cant even hold <num> fps on the x due to spaghetti cpu . dont buy until they fix it .
__label__unhelpful the creators want money and nothing else
__label__helpful please add a change screen bounds option some the game gets cut off
__label__helpful dab crash a lot but dab
__label__unhelpful game is sooooo laggy doesnt even load right . by far the most trash game of <num>
__label__unhelpful its a good game but they need to disable team kill , i get tire of team mates killing you to get your guns . why do games allow team killing anyways , dumb mfs .
__label__helpful this game ran better before all of the updates , now my game takes a good <num> minutes to render in structures . also i tend to die by clipping into invisible objects midgame . hitboxes need a lot of work still because its possibe to be shot through walls sometimes or someone can unload a clip in you close range without even facing your direction , and expect to crash alot . the game crashes randomly at the worst possible times and it tends to crash as you are loading back in aswell . this is really bad for solo players because you could be <num> minutes into a game and get eliminated due to crashing . this game is very fun but it just seems to be getting worse .
__label__unhelpful lags all the time bullets dont register such a cheap bs game
__label__unhelpful fun <num> . <num> of the time <emoji>
__label__helpful why cant we earn coins if we win a match or get to a certain level ? thatd give people a reason to play more .
__label__helpful the game is not fully done so stop crying and put up with it
__label__helpful my son got me hooked , now we play together every morning .
__label__helpful the games shooting mechanics take no skill as the shotgun is so inconsistent and ar bullets dont go where they are supposed to go . the only decent part about this game that takes some skill is sniping . the game also takes so long to switch and equip weapons and the servers kick you out for no reason . this game needs to be fixed by epic games . until then , i will never admit it to being even a decent game . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful if this was high school project i would understand . of course its early access , but i truly feel the devs are intentionally messing this game up . there must be an inside joke at bluhole that anyone who purchased this game is an and lets remind them of that .
__label__helpful awesome new blocks , super cool game !
__label__helpful wonderful gameplay , all <num> playable game modes are lots of fun alone or with friends . the game is a pretty intense battle royale title and is decently competitive too . the most recent patch (im on the regular old xbox one) has reduced rubberbanding when moving and network lag in my experience . less frequently (at least <num> of matches in my experience) but consistently , a lot of players still experience the entire game crashing . i am updating from <num> of <num> stars to <num> of <num> for the moment . i would now currently recommend purchasing pubg if the crashing in the meantime doesnt bother you . the devs have made making the game crashfree one of their top priorittes for <num> , so hopefully it continues to improve .
__label__unhelpful by the time that this game reaches a state that is any where close to being worth its cost , something much better will be out for battle royal fans to play . pubg is dying fast . they ruined their chance to be something great . by the end of the year this game will be done for . garbage uninstalled <emoji> money wasted <emoji> good bye <emoji> ✌
__label__unhelpful i got this game because pubg was laggy and full of desync . i had heard better about this game . thats all wrong . if youre looking for battle royale just get pubg .
__label__helpful you can build whatever you like
__label__helpful update : the game is getting better , give it a . try if youre interested ! still has a long way to go though . <emoji>
__label__helpful this is the video game equivalent of slamming your d in a car door . its painfully exhilarating while terrifying and sexy . sometimes youll need held afterwards and other times youll be ready and raring for another go immediately .
__label__helpful performs a lot better then the java version of minecraft , but its filled with micro transactions , which , fair enough dont affect gameplay . but your are missing out on a lot of freedom in this version of minecraft , as it does not support mods , and the texture packs cost money , which is kind of a bummer . and please fix the awful water texture when viewing the water from anywhere but right above it . like what the heck ?
__label__unhelpful it is the most garbage game i have ever played in my life .
__label__unhelpful theres no skill involved with this game . you can spend <num> minutes looting then get sniped by someone who only has a shotgun even though you put put all your shots into them .
__label__helpful i dont like how you have to pay just to be not called a noob ! also just for a free game it has terrible transaction even though the company needs money . the gameplay might be fun but its concept is repeated in a way , also the rng system is kind of balanced . but just for this dumb game my feed is filled with fortnite freaks looking for a team . i know the company cant control that though . in conclusion this is way too popular of a game just for repeated gameplay , but at least its decent .
__label__unhelpful this game its too toxic every game i go into i get tk . even in ranked everything is broken . how is this fair no ranks players vs plats and gold . do not waste your money on this old y game it has <num> years out and it still sucks
__label__helpful dont buy until they fix everything
__label__unhelpful worst game i have ever played
__label__helpful ok now im done . you dont want to fix it fine . your product is now just going to be reported for poor performance . i have asked you guys to fix many times and sunk my hard earned money into it . if you wont do anything then i will .
__label__unhelpful in response to sarcha <num> , pubg is far better than fortnite . if something is hard to be good at then it means you need skill to be good at it . fortnite is easy because <num> of the players are middleschoolers who dont have anything better to do . pubg is better than fortnite <emoji>
