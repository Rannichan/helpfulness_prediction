__label__helpful this game is decent , fun , and addicting . pve and pvp are great . you dont need to spend money to progress . and to the people whining about its price as a game , when its released for free you get your money refunded . so chill out .
__label__unhelpful i spent <num> bucks on a slow paced game with limmited customizatiion , pay to win , team balancing sucks , no story , not good game modes , you rage too much , and overall not enjoyable at all
__label__helpful i love playing this game with my little nephew , its easy to play multiplayer , easy to play period . love playing it alone and with others , its fun and i love how i can broadcast it .
__label__unhelpful the game plays fine , and it can be some fun even though it is based on the mobile minecraft . the only major issue i have with that is the lack of boss mobs . but the main problem is that no audio plays out of my speakers at all . to clarify , my <num> . <num> speaker system is silent while the game is running , but if i have audio play from my headphones , the audio plays normally . this inconvenience makes the game less enjoyable . also , why the heck does the game not freeze when you pause in single player ? its rather infuriating to pause in a cave and come back to find yourself dead .
__label__helpful the game is amazing and so are the mechanics ! it works great on my pc now and i will play minecraft till the end !
__label__helpful very disappointed ! they removed the jiggles from the calamites hoocas (brest) now my peepee doesnt get hard now now i have to go on po hub to watch minecraft lets plays .
__label__helpful this game is so addicting and you can cross play with pocket players , nintendo switch players , and also xbox players !
__label__helpful i screamed when i saw that horses were added . now i can own my own horses , and travel much faster !
__label__helpful after playing for a while i changed my mind and this a pretty good game that i would recomend
__label__helpful this is a great way to test skill and overall fun , but there are some bugs that ruin the game like how sometimes i switch over one slot with a gun , and it throws me on the wrong slot with bandages nd gets me killed . please fix this
__label__helpful i love minecraft ! it is an amazing game that anyone can enjoy , whether you like survivalbased gameplay , messing around with modifications , pvp(player vs . player) , or just straight up building , this is a creative sandbox world were you can do anything your creativity can think of . i love it so much i have it on my macbook , my pc , and my ipad(not to mention my xbox <num> ) . all in all , this deserves a flat <num> out of <num> rating(five stars) because of how many possibilities there are for you to have .
__label__unhelpful purchased , wont load since month <num> , support wont help if needed ! calling for a refund today . <num> . smh i was so excited to play too .
__label__unhelpful i hate everything about this game everything in this game is op nerf everything stop people spamming tilted and also just make save the world free
__label__unhelpful the problem with this game is when you start playing multyplayer you dont get paired up with people your the same level as so you fight high level players . all of the actually good classes you have to buy the season pass for so that sucked . then theres all of these bugs like on free weekend you couldnt play multyplayer . but overall its alright , if your actually good .
__label__helpful i like how the app store ver . of minecraft is sort of like the mobile version with the main menu and pause menu etc . but i would prefer the multiplayer to be on the main menu like on the original downloaded version from the minecraft website because i have and many other people have gotten used to that . also because you are sort of remaking the game maybe you could add a mods tab as well as texture packs , because everyone wants mods and having a mods tab would make things a whole lot easier like installing a texture pack , having this would be awesome ; besides that the beta is great so far and hope to see what the windows <num> edition brings
__label__helpful i dont like that only <num> people can join you
__label__helpful its a great game but i really wish they would have a better team balancing system because im always paired up with noobs or trolls . i wish they also had a campaign so i can sit back and relax instead of being tense all the time because there is always at least one try hard on a team for casual . i also want them to fix the ranking system because i was playing with my friends and lost connection to the r <num> servers and when i rejoined my game i lost the match and lost two ranks because it counted some for leaving the match and the loss . i know its in beta but it shouldnt do that to me . also even with the new update there is actually still some bad hit registration because i headshotted a guy <num> times chest shotted him <num> times but nothing happened even after my friend shot him <num> more times in the chest . its a good game but they should fix some of this . they also need to fix the teamkilling banning system because if someone is trolling you can only kill them once otherwise you get banned
__label__unhelpful nothing beats sitting there in a loading screen .
__label__helpful this game used to be so great . now its a piece of crap . the shotguns are beyond broken , the damage will go from <num> to <num> . in the end , youll just get killed by a submachine gun when you get a good shot off with your shotgun . they nerfed building , nerfed shotguns , and buffed smgs . epic is trash and refuses to listen to any of their community . we all want good and balanced gameplay and epic decides to add in thanking the bus driver . fortnite was in its prime in season <num> . from then on , it has strayed further and further from what it was . epic just needs to fix their game . they finally did something right and then they screwed it up .
__label__helpful excellent adrenaline rush , fun game but buggy as hell . i feel like i have got my moneys worth and it is still in preview . if you want a polished glitch free game this isnt for you . if you have patience and can see the bright side of things and want a new fps experience , pubg is totally worth it . go get those <emoji> dinners ! you will suck at first , die lots and maybe get frustrated but practice makes all the difference . m <num> is <num>
__label__unhelpful lets be real here : java is a horrible language for anything serious . compared to more modern languages , its inefficient and too taxing on systems . one of its only redeeming factors is that its easier to use crossplatform , which is why theres only one version of pc minecraft on osx , windows , and nix . while w <num> edition isnt cross platform , it performs a helluva lot better because of the use of a different , more efficient language . worlds are created and load much faster , and i get much better performance out of this version compared to the old one . <num> . <num> simply because i can play without changing allocation of resources .
__label__helpful first off , this is not pc , with that said its still just a preview , which means unfinished . the controls take a few games to get used to , but easily learnable on the go . some minor glitches , minor lag , nothing game breaking . its worth the $ <num> because it will improve .
__label__helpful this game breaks every week . they dont care about fixing this game for console , its been over a month since building broke and theyve done nothing . dont worry though this game on pc got fixed right away .
__label__helpful overall , the game can be fun , character designs are great , maps are fun . you can customize your guns with camos as well as headgear however it looks kinda dumb having arctic camo headgear with a woodland camo bdu . let us change outfits too ! youll be lucky if you dont get team killed for choosing another character that someone else was going to pick or booted for no reason . the comunity is the most toxic comunity i have played with and it makes the game way less enjoyable .
__label__helpful as someone who has played this game on pc since its release , bluel has delivered exactly what was promised with this release . they stated all while back that the xbox release would be about <num> months behind the pc version . but in fact , this game is even better than it was <num> months ago on pc because <num> months ago on pc . it didnt even have vaulting . with a better launch than this years call of duty title i can give nothing but credit to blue hole and the work , they put into this launch . while it does have bugs blue always proven that there are committed developer and has already delivered on many of the promises they made early in the games existence . the game is definitely worth $ <num> and while there is a bit of a learning curve i guarantee you will have tons of fun on this game . must buy for $ <num> .
__label__unhelpful put aside the bugs , glitches , and lag ts a great game . i love playing this with my friends even if <num> of the time we lose . all of the <num> year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop , as this game deserves at least <num> . <num> stars . the shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know , as well as some other serious problems like stw scammers and lag . if you are under <num> years of age you probably shouldnt play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some <num> year old tryhard , so for the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are <num> or older . try to not think about the glitches and other cons , and just have fun . i also highly recommend buying save the world , but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed . great game , <num> stars from me .
__label__unhelpful it need work but overall i enjoy playing it . to all the negative reviews what part of early access dont you understand .
__label__unhelpful broken garbage . words cant describe how this game . broken , tiered weapons . rewarded for luck this game takes <num> skill . building is dumb af . this is a childspoor mans battle royale . play pubg for a real game . not this f <num> p greed fest of a game . you want cool outfit have fun spending <num> $ on one outfit and another twenty for an axe lol you epic eat . ur game . the only reason people play this trash is because its free . nobody would buy this trash ever ! also fortnite wasnt a br game at first . now your team focuses <num> on br and said founders who supported this trash b <num> br . epic ill never support another game you make ever .
__label__helpful while i get why people could love this game , it has so many problems . not just in performance , but overall design . the gunplay is terrible and feels awful to use . theres no progression system whatsoever . half of the game is a running simulator . due to all of this , i am already starting to get bored after <num> games . there just isnt much to it other than its basic concept . if you arent an attention streamer , then i dont recommend it .
__label__unhelpful best game i have ever played never lags game play great also im on the original xbox one .
__label__unhelpful i like a lot minecraft and i can play this everyday and is more cool then mcpe
__label__helpful i like how it is compatible with pocket edition so i can play it with my friends . but while playing multiplayer it crashes sometimes . it also needs much more items , ike the pc version . overall it is a fun game .
__label__helpful nothin to say its epic except the game said no and picked a male character instead now i have to pay to change my gender . greatest game ever
__label__unhelpful feels like <num> on gamecube . graphics really bad and the guns aim and controls are bad . hitbox is bad too . the division survival mode beat this by a long run . hope the game is unfinished because i waste my money on this card board game .
__label__helpful seriously , what epic has done to shotguns is sad . all the little noob dont need to be spoonfed skill ! i havent even hit over <num> with one of the strongest if not the strongest shotty in the game . its really pathetic on how epic has managed to somehow make shotguns one of the worst things to have with you . you have a very small chance of getting a <num> shot or <num> with any shotty . this new meta also ruins the point of building ou just constantly get lasered and shot down by horrible players with smgs . plus , in squads , almost every team are sweats with loads of smgs . (good luck with that) these guns are based on pure luck . no skill included , spray and pray is the meta . this game actually used to be fun . (until season <num> smg patches and ridiculous shotty nerfs) if you wish to start playing now , just pick up mainly smgs and other spraying weapons . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i am not a fan . i think its too much like pubg . it also gets boring . the only good part is the save the world and the cool loot lama .
__label__unhelpful if you are a major buy in , youll love this game . personally it feels like you are nerfed otherwise . i despise , no , i loathe this game .
__label__unhelpful too start , i love this game but having to spend money on another season pass is bs , even for ubisoft .
__label__unhelpful i wish they did not add rocket launcher because people use them alot and it does alot of damage sometimes my game lags when people kill me with a rocket launcher <emoji>
__label__helpful at the current time , the game has a few bugs that need some fixing ; however , i am loving the speed of the game and it definitely has great potential . i also greatly enjoy the link between this game and the xbox platform . it gives native xbox players reason to play the game . ; ) dont judge it too harshly , it is still in beta .
__label__helpful this is a great game . i play it constantly and its addictive . keep up the good work .
__label__unhelpful when i play my cursor keeps on pulling up the taskbar and the tab for the game and it keeps on , not only that but swaping out items just bugs out sometimes , i know this is still beta but come on its been out long enough
__label__helpful this game is fantastic . it is very addictive and can help in real life in many ways like you could design a scale model of a building that you might build in real life . it allows you to play on minecraft pe servers and on minecraft pe worlds . it is a version of minecraft pe but for windows <num> pcs . it gets the updates that minecraft pe gets and stays level with the features the $ <num> pcmac version has . there is a small delay between the updates between the pcmac version and minecraft windows <num> edition beta . this game is great and is worth the $ <num> .
__label__helpful i think it is a great game , and i love how it can connect with pocket edition , but what i dont like about it is that it is too similar to classic computer edition , i think it needs something original , like maybe a boss , or a new realm . but if you ignore that , than it is a pretty good game ! (and by the way , for the people who think its too muck like pocket edition , it is pocket edition on computer ! )
__label__unhelpful movement controls are terrible . feels like moving with the dpad . aiming is terrible . not fluid . rendering on xbox one x is still garbage despite the enhancements . hdr makes game way too dim with no option to control brightness or contrast . controls are clunky and feel like an obvious keyboard game transitioned to a controller with far less buttons . was very hyped . but after a few games im very disappointed .
__label__helpful love the game , but there are still many issues in need of tlc . first , playing with friends is a joke . if you are <num> + level difference , forget about being social . to progress through the levels after the initial <num> hours play time requires either money spent on vbucks or a lot of in game time . not suprising since this game will be free to play in the near future , but still frustrating ( <num> + hours for one tech node at level <num> [obviously im not their yet , but i did the math]) . all that being said . great game .
__label__unhelpful fantastic addition to the minecraft library . simple interface and controls .
__label__unhelpful i like the game it is so much fun ! but sometimes it can get a little stressing and confusing and i dont know what to do ! but over all i mostly enjoy it like i said before ! : )
__label__unhelpful originally it was a pretty sluggish port . then the big <num> . <num> patch came and changed everything . if you have a windows <num> device at all , this is a must have . <num> would play again .
__label__helpful epic games moar liek bepis games there are not enough deagles good way to keep your virginity
__label__helpful touch controls are hard to use at times , but it supports controllers and keyboardmouse also . performs better than java based version on the same hardware . i have always been a fan of the game and have played it on almost all platforms ! highly recommended , and very addicting !
__label__helpful very nice . the animation seems fast and smooth and the interface reminds me of the pocket edition .
__label__helpful everything seems fine to me .
__label__unhelpful i used to hate this game a lot when it first came out . but know im liking the game im happy i gave it a second chance . i play this on pc its better but xbox its okay . i have played three seasons <num> , <num> and <num> and i have gotten better and its really fun . i love the changes that they made it make the game better and i do regret hating the game i would had the skull trooper and dark knight . <num> . <num> being a great game .
__label__helpful pubg has become one of my most likedplayed game in the past months . the evolution of this game since it’s release has been amazing . the way that the games developers take criticism from the community to improve the experience the game delivers is relieving . the close quarter combat cannot be mimicked , the heart clenching final moments of the final circles , and the rewarding feeling of a chicken dinner are aspects of this game that stick out to me and drive me back to it ! i reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge of both awareness and skill . if you enjoy pushing yourself to dominate the battlefield , this game is for you . if you enjoy occasionally hitting your team mates with a car , this game is also for you . the only thing i would improve with the game is a consistency with weapons in structures . i would also have to say let the community have access to custom servers so more content can be pushed out into the community !
__label__helpful this game is amazn untill u lag out
__label__unhelpful this game has been in development for many years but you would i have a better chance of finding a cure for cancer than playing a game without roamers . the matchmaking system is a steaming pile of . im not even ranked but i still get place against level <num> s and diamonds . i give this one star because i have been playing this game for a span of <num> years but have not seen a improvement in gameplay . why does there always have to be a roamer on the enemy team . everygame i played there was a roamer . do not buy this stinky pile of horse diarrhea .
__label__helpful ive been playing minecraft for a few years now , and i love it when it branches out like this . but i was disappointed to learn that there are key features missing from it , like trading with villagers , that the other versions of the game have . if those were added on , then it is definitely a <num> star game , without a doubt in my mind . i still love the game , regardless !
__label__unhelpful it cost almost as much as the java version but is way slower , harder to use , and you cant change the version to get a different style of pvp , many servers are not compatable with this .
__label__helpful its fun with friends . ya it needs more work . but still fun . id recommend this game to others .
__label__helpful its woth the money but make sure you get the season pass , not needed but very much recomended <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the game is good for the price it is at right now($ <num> . <num> ) . there are many things that are limited compared to the pc version . for example you can not download any mods or skins . you are able to buy skins but that just makes it feel like the normal console edition for xbox . one thing that really bothers me though is the fact that you can not look at your coordinates . this can be very frustrating especially if you are big into building and mining . for the price ($ <num> . <num> ) it is a good buy , but once the price goes back up and it is the same as the pc edition ($ <num> . <num> ) i would suggest just getting the pc edition instead
__label__helpful an absolute visual representation of cancer . <num> should be removed from space and time . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i love this game every update adds better graphics and awesome weapons keep it up !
__label__helpful i know its not a finished game but it feels so clunky . like halo <num> clunky
__label__helpful this is one of the best games ever . u can build whatever u want its so simple and easy . i hope others download thi gam . it is so fun many people say its boring but i think not , i think minecraft is actually the best game ever created so if u dont like it dont spread false claims cause thats not very cool an it turns out the ones who spread rumors are the ones that like it the most . take my advise people !
__label__unhelpful there is no difference between the two . if you already have the tablet version , forget about this version and get the actual pc port ! if you dont have a credit card , buy a minecraft card at walmart an put it into the scratchoff back pin into the free downloaded driver (useless unless you create a account with the pin number) and you have the real version of minecraft ! the only setback is that its $ <num> more , yet worth way more . so , only get this tablettopc version as a last resort . youre better off getting the real version .
__label__helpful great game to play with friends or solo but ive ran into a couple glitches . sometimes building dont render in after landing . ive been stuck in a wall due to that . game crashed several times but im assuming since it was the first day the servers had a few troubles . had fun doing solo , duo , and squad . recommend getting it but it is still going to have glitches til it is out of the game preview program
__label__unhelpful really epic yesterday i was soo excited ill today i go online and my battle pass is gone if u can do it for me my account is jaleel swag boy all caps no numbers
__label__helpful fun game just wish it had everything the real version has .
__label__helpful i love the gameplay but <num> its laggy and <num> theres major problems with installing and uinstalling save the world . i accidentally uinstalled save the world and so i tried to install it back but my luck it just kept saying instllization stopping and it stopped at <num> and wouldent go up . so i . reset my xbox and i canceled my que but when i looked at my games fortnite wasant there , so i went to my install tab and it said the whole game wasant installed . to sum it . if you try to installsave the world and u cancel que cause it dosent work it uinstalls the whole game :
__label__unhelpful app doesnt even open ran fine with a few expected glitches of a beta for awhile now the game doesnt even open up . even having trouble finding a uninstall option to reinstall it .
__label__helpful dont get conned by the windows store , this isnt some new and improved version of mc for windows <num> . this is literally just minecraft pe with a fancy new title for more than <num> x the price . save yourself the trouble and just get normal minecraft .
__label__unhelpful the ui is terrible , you cant right click to quick switch blocks out and there is no inventory in creative mode . no mod support , inapp purchases are just lame skins . you can get free skins elsewhere . its several versions behind the real pc version . limited max view distance which is basically the same as the xbl version .
__label__unhelpful if you loved high class desserts this game is that . the problem is now imagine youre only allowed to lick it and sometimes its made wrong . do not buy right now until its fixed . high frame drop , lots of lag , and its rare when u play a match without crashing
__label__unhelpful have not played many games online where teams were not imbalanced from drop offs , kicks , late game insertions , or poor connection , game lag . beware the console version is not on par with pc where these issues are resolved .
__label__helpful now , i started playing minecraft on pc around <num> . <num> . <num> and i absolutely fell in love with it ! i wanted to gain my skills enough to eventually join a quest to slay the dragon like in peanut butter gamers series . i have tried minecraft on my ipad , and on my android phone but none had the functionality and full capacity that the pc version did . one thing that left me wanting though was controller compatibility . i had an xbox controller but to use it with minecraft , i had to use <num> rd party programs , which were a pain to work with . alas , we have the perfect combination of a full minecraft game , with the simplistic menus of the tablet version , and the controller option that ive been wanting all along ! its good so far ! <num> thing though . when i pause the game , i expect everything to freeze right when i hit pause . save me from a quick death or maybe just going out to type a review . but it keeps running even when paused . dangerous when against enemies . please fix this annoyance and it will be <num> .
__label__helpful as time passed , i learned cosmetics dont help you win . i dont have skins but i have <num> wins total . i think we need servers for different skill levels and vbucks based on placement and kills . if you had wins before it would be added to your account . thank you , epic . <emoji>
__label__helpful <num> : make the mini map in the corner have color please . <num> : graphics obviously . <num> : fix the first person view where when your running you dont like automatically look slightly somewhere else . <num> : do you think you make it where you dont have to double click left trigger to ads please . <num> : make the invintory more simple please . <num> : make it were you can change the button lay out because no offense but the controls are pretty confusing . <num> : lag fixes . theres a lot more things but hey game cam out yesterday so . yeah anyways love you pubg <emoji>
__label__helpful you just do the same thing over and over again . it would be good to make a sandbox mode without the objectives .
__label__helpful i literally wait for an hour to get in a server and once im done it keeps giving me more minutes . they might as well have told me to go myself in the !
__label__helpful i love how this game has so many uses and possibilities . you can let your mind flow in creative by building anything from mansions to amusement parks to zombie traps . survival of the fittest is the law in mode survival . collect resources to build your dream house from scratch or simply explore your world . you can play by yourself with only the company of animals or invite your friends in multiplayer . theres still so many more options . download minecraft for just $ <num> and check it out for yourself ! get crafting !
__label__unhelpful its far far from the real thing but still has the basic concept . so i gave it a <num> for that reason . but its still fun to play now and then .
__label__helpful i like how they manage to keep the old aspects of the minecraft and yet bring it to a whole new level of fun .
__label__helpful its a wonderful time waster , and it runs really smoothly . i only have one issue , but i dont know if its because of the game or my surface . occasionally some stuff such as item counts and the crafting menu will remain imprinted on the screen , even after i close the application . it goes away once i close and open my surface again , though . its not a major issue , just slightly annoying .
__label__unhelpful its coded in c++ , right ? if so , then its poorly optimized . all minecraft versions have been like that so far . its lacking quite a few details that should be easy to port to c++ . other than that , it is minecraft , and the interface is simple , and it does run a little better than the previous version . looks like a college student project to say the least .
__label__unhelpful yesterday ive downloaded this for free with my code and i was having fun with it but for some reason today i tried opening the app and it woldnt work it just stayed in the mojang symbol , than i tried looking at task manager and noticed that minecraft was in background app not a app someone please help ! also someone else having the problem that the you see the loading screen and you cant even find the install button and the loading symbols just stays there doing nothing ? its happening to me in all the apps please help me ! (i tried reinstalling minecraft btw)
__label__helpful they market the game as though its a complete game , but really all you are paying for is access to the beta of a game that will eventually be f <num> p . other than that , the game is heavily grindingmicrotransaction based . the gameplay takes place in missions rather than the open world one would expect from this genre of game , meaning nearly everything you make each mission is gone upon completion .
__label__helpful the gun play and lag are so bad you can be killed by an unarmed player even if you are shooting them with a shotgun <emoji> <num> updates no better <emoji>
__label__helpful its identicle to minecraft pocket edition in almost every way . it is not the java version so do not expect to be able to install any kind of mods or having clothing layers (yet) . aside from being a slightly inferior version to the java version it does boast great stability in contrast . the integration of xbox live makes this title much easier to get into with friends but be warned : you will not have massive server population like in the java version . i believe this version only supports up to <num> players on one server . its a good price for a good game but until it acquires more functions to match up to the java version you are to expect a slightly limited playing experience . despite that i highly recommend this version of the game if you want stability and you dont mind vanilla gameplay .
__label__unhelpful this game , should not be out yet . its very broken and online play is awful . not nearly as many options , you have no way of knowing your location without using cheats , so in multiplayer if you get lost no finding your way back and might as well create a new game . it will drop you randomly , and cannot be trusted to save games accurately . i will still play the java version until this game is not broken . great idea , but ideas work if the game works .
__label__unhelpful i have been playing since the first day , and i still get on fortnite every day . people dont understand that they are hating on a free to play game and complaining about the current metta . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful so what this god damn game is telling me is that could have <num> hp and <num> sheild and the other can have <num> hp if i shoot him with a scar ith all my ammo they dont die and if they shoot me once with a lil pump i die this game needs another update and if you make it even worse im uninstalling <emoji>
__label__unhelpful first off , this games just hopping on the battle royale band wagon . and second , the games hitboxes are so random that you cant even hit someone in the chest with a rifle when they are <num> feet away . edit : just replayed it for a while and it still sucks
__label__helpful pubg is a really fun game . i love the last one standing gameplay . the controls are great . the main problems are the lag and the crashing . the game is really laggy in the starting area , but it clears up once you land . every two or three games , pubg crashes , which is annoying . rendering is a issue . many times , i have found things like buildings , trees , ect . not rendering in for a while . finally , the lack of hitmarkers is a huge problem . the closest thing to a hitmarker , is a blood splatter . it is realistic , but there is a few things they need to fix . overall , this is a great game for being in game preview . after a few fixes are made , this will be a amazing game . i cant wait to play the final game !
__label__helpful i was playing off and on for about <num> months and besides slow load time when starting a round i was in love with this game but with the last update all my gears and money ive earned is gone even the gear i started with and the stuff they gave us like a month or two ago all gone . wtf !
__label__helpful for being a clone of the mobile version , it is pretty fun to play . controller support is good . still needs work .
__label__unhelpful tired of ubisofts infrastructure and season <num> , <num> , <num> , <num> bs . buyer beware . this franchise is a cash grab off of a once great game series . my year <num> dlc disappeared for no reason . cant redownload it !
__label__helpful good i understand the games been out a week but u guys work on graphics im <num> k on a s but its gotta be dealt with but good game . update from week <num> to now . thanks to the newest update performance issues are low and graphics are getting better .
__label__helpful constant updates have improved pubg for xbox tremendously in the last month . added new controls for controllers and they listen to our feedback . one or two updates a week . they are putting in real work to fix this game and much faster than the pc version . if youve been holding off now is a good time to get your feet wet
__label__unhelpful this game destroyed my life .
__label__unhelpful do you enjoy hating your free time ? does your job not frustrate you enough ? are you a masochist ? then this the game for you ! it will punish you like dark souls . and the best part is that it will be a real person who punishes for even trying to play this game . save your money for something enjoyable
__label__unhelpful i think for the xbox , windows <num> , ps <num> , pocket , and all the other editions except pc , because you already did add one in pc , add a sprint button ! and this game to me just doesnt feel like home to me like <num> . <num> pc . also please make the control settings better . and just for sake i dont like your idea on making mc more realistic and i hate pc <num> . <num> and <num> . <num> pvp . thanks . oh but i love realms
__label__helpful any game made by epic is epic at first then slowly dies . a good example is the gears franchise and now this . this game has so many unbalanced mechanics that its more rngspam based than skill based . dont believe me , find the compact smg (p <num> ) or anything automatic using small ammo . new to the game or dont play enough ? great ! youll run into more sweaty , build god players who play this game almost <num> that you wont be able to learn the game because youll be dying so much (hiding all game doesnt help either) . oh and if you already know how to play , great ! youll have a boring build off of who can build faster than just height advantage the enemy player . you like the skins and emotes ? pay $ <num> $ <num> for them each . this game is popular because of streamersyoutubers possibly being paid by epic games to promote it . btw , if you didnt know , fortnite br has made <num> billion+ dollars in a year so its very possible ; otherwise , not many players would be playing this . tl ; dr dont install !
__label__helpful i really wish that there was an actual save button for offline playing . twice now ive left my game and it didnt save almost <num> hrs worth of work and it is rather frustrating . otherwise it is an awesome game though more features from pc version would fantastic .
__label__unhelpful this game is utter . you land into a world of solid cubes until about the first <num> seconds then blobs of houses begin to show with no interior . fighting is decent but still terrible for how many peeple play this game bluehole is completely taking advantage of us as gamers $ <num> for somthing that looks like a game from xbox original . i thought id love this game but its all hype atleast fortnite is free and the graphics arnt complete garbage even the map is fing boring ! run for <num> minutes though barren open ground to a already looted building wow so much fun <emoji>
__label__helpful the best game in bugs
__label__helpful love the game play and it runs great , besides a few force closes . the issues i had previously had was fixed by a supportive staff member . game runs smooth . cant wait to see what they update .
__label__helpful if you like crashing <num> times a game youll love it . if you enjoy bushes looking like people youll love it . if you like boulders looking like jeeps youll love it . if you enjoy minecraft rendering youll love it . if you like picking up a vest and helmet that doesnt work youll love it . this game is a real treat . p . s . on the menu screen they tell you they might not release the finished product and the game will forever be a humpback whale trying to walk .
__label__helpful fortnite is the most autistic game . it inverted my penis .
__label__helpful i am a large fan of minecraft . i have known about and played the game for many years now . i always loved the game . i bought the java edition (twice) and the pe version . the java edition was great , i got everything i wanted and more . the pe edition was good , but it didnt feel too fun . when i heard that windows <num> edition was coming out , i felt optimistic for the future (plus i basically had two free copies from the java versions i bought) . it was nice , but didnt live up to my expectations . now i see that there are microtransactions everywhere . this is exactly the direction i didnt want the game to go . locking down the community and making you pay for everything . microsoft is forcing everyone to leave the java edition , by making every other version compatible with one another , except for good old java . buy the java version , since you can play on windows <num> with it , but also because it comes with a free copy of windows <num> . tl ; dr : buy the java version . you can thank me later .
__label__helpful map doesnt load when landing falling through buildings for first <num> seconds atleast if you dont fall through a house or mountain <emoji> shot register and hit boxes are off . other then that i love the bloodthirst fight for victory from all different aspects . the game crashes are a problem slight and not as frequent but now itll say host closed connection an i guess you waste <num> min stocking an fighting for nothing , especially if youre in the final <num> or less . credits someties arent given if system crashes enough or host closes connection and youre always told better luck next time <emoji> addictingly fun for being the best game with realistic battle royale . also would be nice if i didnt have to lay on the ground in order to over hand throw a grenada .
__label__unhelpful so now . it only freezes when i have wifi on but when airplane mode is on its fine , is this fixable ?
__label__helpful hi , i absolutely love minecraft ! it is really fun and enjoyable for all ages . my dad even played with me when i was <num> . (i am now <num> ) . it is the best ! i simply enjoy building for hours at a time . honestly if you want to download it , you should . building with everything is really fun . i am going to buy it soon . : d
__label__unhelpful no explanation but worth it✌ <emoji>
__label__helpful pretty fun , but gets tiring after no that long . very repititive , even with weekly changes .
__label__helpful everything has changed dramatically . cant wait for multiplayer .
__label__helpful yd yall make a ps <num> skin but still aint made a xbox skin <emoji>
__label__helpful by all means the game is great but the fact that i used $ <num> on the game makes me dissatisfied and disappointed <emoji> because the game is gonna . be free if i knew that i would of waited for the game <emoji>
__label__helpful it used to be amazing but now it crashes .
__label__helpful this game is crap . you will be in the last minute of whatever you are doing and it just freezes and boots you . loved the game when it first came out then they did crap updates and fixed nothing . dont buy . wait till its free for a freeze game !
__label__helpful weapons are extremely unbalanced , hit registration is non existant half of the time , and spontaneous death occurs way yoo often from a single bullet from anything . not to mention the weapon accuracy seems to be luck based .
__label__unhelpful i am a left handed person and when it came out i got my free copy . i thought that this would be a great way to play with my sister that only plays pe . when i opened it up i saw that it was at the moment a direct port of pe with some keybinds slapped on to it but after all it was just released . so i waited a few months and tried it again . with only one update and no progress it had not changed . the cross platform multiplayer still did not work and the only thing changed for the better was that i could now use the rmb to click on things in the menu and not only the lmb . i will look at it again in the future but at the moment i will stick to the pc version .
__label__unhelpful worst update to date , my paintings are gone , animals are despawning again , cannot open inventory without game crashing . my game isnt even playable unless i somehow find a way not to open my inventory and you kind of need that to equip armor ect . you are expecting people to start paying $ <num> . <num> when all your updates seem to include is more issues than the last . such a frustrating game .
__label__helpful this is such a fun and addicting game . great graphics and brings a more updated experience to minecraft . the only problem here is that the game freezes almost every <num> minutes , even when im jumping . please fix this as this is very annoying and makes it harder to play .
__label__helpful though it does not have all the features that the desktop edition has , i am really liking this version . it runs nicely on my dual core machine , startup is faster than the desktop version , and it is easier to switch between the game and other windows . when my kids play the desktop version , i often have to get involved to do some kind of tech support . the windows <num> edition is so much cleaner and easier to get started . it is easier to for them to get a multiplayer game going too . i enjoy not having to get involved . it ties in to xbox live nicely .
__label__helpful thank you for the keyboard controllability it makes moving through the game much easier ! id love to be able to have photo realistic texture packs and skins added to the list of available recourse packs , along with command blocks since they improve the game by greatly adding to your creative abilities . also adding the ability to use the lightning bolt command as a decoration or maybe as a functional feature to a power system for a build or weapons system in game . and the ability to resize objects and items . and some way of contacting a live breathing support agent if needed for in game help and troubleshooting and tech support .
__label__helpful while the game combines several familiar and common elements from so many games epic games has pull it off in a way that makes this game truely feel and play like an innovative oneofakind orginal ! on the fence , i initially spent a few hours reading early alpha reviews and other posts prior to buying the limited edition founders pack ; afterwards i can say with the bonus loot and game keys for friends it was money well spent ! my friends and i are now having a blast after rotating on and off of so many other games . this game really offers something for everyone and has it all ! the building customization , heroschematicfollower leveling system along with an incredibly diverse and detailed researchskill tree system will undoubtly provide years of fantastic game play . in addition , the daily login rewards are very generous and actually provide useful items . you might think the missions may get repetitious ; but the crafting and progression keep you coming back for more ! ~ enjoy !
__label__unhelpful its so bad , if youre like me and you like competive if you get social banned like me atm you cant communicate all characters half to be unlocked its done poorly unlike for honor or palaidins you die way to fast and you need to wait <num> minutes to respawn the characters dont fit in terrorist hunt is a bad gamemode they crapped out their is basically no campaign the ranking system is boring no one picks right choices they dont care if they loose in compt and youre stuck in the worst rank cause of that everything melts even the handguns dont waste youre money buying bo <num> or iw and going to play hardcore snd would be the same but enjoyable with and without friends
__label__helpful rainbow six siege is a really fun game to play wheither youre competitive or a casual player . it is mainly a tactical semi slow paced shooter . there is new content , new characters and maps every season . the game leans more towards the competitive side and it is alot of fun with friends , going solo is not as much fun most of the time but there is a strong community for the game so finding players is easy there are also some draw backs to the game for example the game is pleagued with bad servers and hit regisration and net code problems . matchmaking can also be very frustrating with re joining games you quit or getting stuck at an loading screen and then having to restart the game . <num> years later they still have not fixed these issues and are consentrating more on adding free and paid content instead of fixing the core game first . alpha packs (rng loot boxes) are also a thing but they are <num> cosmetic . there are also <num> or more types of currency for the game which is very confusing .
__label__unhelpful this game gives me sleep paralysis from boredom , its the same process over and over
__label__unhelpful reminds me of pocket edition has potential but one star from me for now
__label__helpful this game is very fun and toxic at the same time . if you are good at cod or bf then you should not think this game as run in guns blazing and to see what that wierd noise was because you will die from trained or good players . the game has all these charecters that have their specific gadget for strategic plays but i dont think the dlc characters shold cost money
__label__unhelpful its great but it needs better controller support(like exactly straight from the xbone <num> version) , it feels awkward compared to the consoles in creative mode . it also needs the crafting guide from the console version too , im not trying to get a online guide or memorize combinations for crafting . it definitely needs big updates for this game , maybe ill change up the score after it feels more like the console version with the big benefits of the pc version but for now , it feels like i cant enjoy this game like i do on the xbone .
__label__unhelpful the mcpe windows <num> is not free so peppeal cant download miecraft : ( pls make it free thank you .
__label__helpful i like all the updates
__label__unhelpful ive been wating for this game forever and it finally came out !
__label__helpful im only putting <num> stars becuase ps <num> gets cool free stuff and we dont if we dont get any thing i will delete fortnite
__label__unhelpful decent game though its a pubg rip off with major lag on servers . you die before ever knowing you are in a gun fight because of laggy servers .
__label__helpful the gameplay is fine , i just do not like the obnoxious people that ruin fortnite itself . <num> stars for the game <num> star for the players .
__label__unhelpful i always play pvp on windows <num> edition but i noticed something in the update <num> . <num> . <num> . i got used to the real hit detector and in the <num> . <num> . <num> update the hit detector is not good . its almost like im playing <num> . <num> pvp where i hit a player and i cant hit them for like <num> to <num> seconds and then i can hit them again . this process repeats and it is really annoying please fix this . thank you .
__label__helpful the game was good at first until they decided that stuff that wasnt really broken needed to be fixed . if you do buy expect headshots to not matter and poor matchmakings
__label__unhelpful okay , so for around most of the year ive been wanting to play this game . but i cant due to the fact that the screen doesnt load in before the actual game ? so im having to hope when i land that im not near anyone as i have to prone to wait for the screen to load . yes you heard right . i have to wait for the game to load its own screen . how about a ? oh , i dont know , a loading screen ! or just dont put me in the damn game
__label__unhelpful i liked original minecraft , meaning before the windows <num> version . here are a few reasons why : <num> . directx <num> and not java this is very important for people who dont have expensive gaming rigs . on original minecraft there were enough options for graphics that made the game a smoother and more enjoyable experience through the power of java . directx <num> isnt made for streamline pcs . meaning if all you have is your moms work laptop to read this , your out of luck . <num> . too much like mobile this game looks like it was made for tablets , from the u . i , to the controls , and to the graphics . this is just microsofts way of saying well heres another uncompleted version of a game youve been waiting for , for the past <num> years , and <num> . you have to pay for the beta really ? $ <num> for a beta ? i mean its not that bad but if your new to minecraft this isnt the way to start . it will most likely be another $ <num> for the full game anyways ! so unless you already own minecraft on pc , dont get it !
__label__helpful game is good . its not perfect and still in development .
__label__unhelpful it runs like garbage for <num> $ . fortnite is free and is much more user friendly , with devs that actually care about the game . this game seems like a rushed cash grab . yes , i understand its a game preview , but thats not a valid excuse for this pile of garbage .
__label__helpful loot requires microtransactions . <num> skill trees = unnecessarily complex systems detract from core gameplay which is fun but underdeveloped . all quests are essentially the same .
__label__helpful craches on the mojang logo . even in the newest version .
__label__unhelpful the aiming system is horrible
__label__helpful avoid quickplay <num> of matches are gnna end in someone rage teamkilling you fr zero reaspn . best fps out still
__label__helpful with the number of units sold and the overall popularity of this game , its quite baffling that the game was released in its current state . whenif the game works , it is quite fun and fairly easy to look over the plethora of bugs that exist . crashing multiple times in a single session is a little more difficult to look past . ive played most of the available preview games available on the xbox , several costing less money , that are far more polished than pubg . hopefully the money made from the not so subtle cash grab port goes towards the game that so many people are supporting . it could easily be a <num> or <num> star game if some more time goes into it . <num> graphics and single digit frame rates aside , this game is oodles of fun . also , stop selling $ <num> cosmetic items and maybe focus on fixing the game instead .
__label__helpful fun , simple , and a great way to pass time . i do wish and think it should be more touchscreen friendly . since i own a microsoft tabet .
__label__helpful can yall fix the crashing and it still lets you run or drive when it crashes please fix
__label__helpful new map is terrible and made the game run like complete crap fix what is already messed up then add things
__label__helpful could do with less lag
__label__helpful game just kept on crashing wen we wer going to fight or , geting shot dont buy or play till later updates
__label__helpful epicgames claims the game is fair . that is until you unload an entire shotgun in someone and they just shoot you with a pistol once . the amount of bs this game pours out is bad enough , in addition they cant even make their own emotes , but rather copy dances and gestures . id recommend pubg if you are looking for a game that has significantly less lag , bs , cheaters , and server problems . server problems happening all the time , as in about five times a month . on top of that it takes hours or days to get through a login queue , just to have it fail and wait again . if you plan to buy the game , if you havent already , save your money , the game is too broken .
__label__helpful its woth it just get past a few bugs and and low frames rates for the time being . but enjoy pure tactical with realistic hit counters and weapon physics .
__label__unhelpful i like how its challenging , but the trail , only <num> minutes . i dont like that .
__label__unhelpful gracias israel por la cuenta
__label__helpful since updates the game has gotten better
__label__unhelpful so i rush a kid with double green pump and each of my shots do <num> damage and all headshots . especially the lag makes it worse
__label__helpful slow and scratchy and never runs smooth , mobile runs better
__label__helpful i play minecraft for pc and for newcomers to minecraft thats where all this began i wanted to test this windows <num> verison and its pretty much the same as pocket and eh its . ok not the best for players that want a pc feel to it but its ok if your looking for a minecraft game that runs on the computer i guess well i hope this helps bye everyone !
__label__unhelpful trash physics doesnt work at all . this game is retarded .
__label__helpful when i try to install it , i get an error .
__label__helpful really fun , lag free , and very inspiring . you can build essentially anything , and the pve is quite fun too .
__label__helpful i get that its a preview and unfinished but its offensive that they charged anyone for this . not sure how the one x performs but its almost unplayable on the og console . wish i could return for a refund
__label__helpful this game is awsome it has good graphic the only thing is tha instead of adding new weapons they should fix the old ones
__label__helpful wow what a pathetic trash kiddie game . cant escape cheaters on any platform now with keyboard and mouse . cant wait for this movement to die trash kids .
__label__unhelpful now granted i enjoy playing this game and being paired with good people , but when you have friends like i do who exclude you from every game , teamkill , and vote you out . then i dont like it . thats been year <num> for me , and now with year <num> coming out here soon . i fear thats going to be the same . i just need better friends , so if anyone is cool and wants to hit me up , do so . i need better people to play rainbow with for year <num> .
__label__unhelpful i like in the java version of minecraft when it tells you the difficulty (peaceful , easy , normal , etc) this version just has a slider but doesnt tell you what level it is . also , i liked being able to hit f <num> and it would tell me what level , what biome , etc i was in , as far as i can tell , this version does not have that .
__label__helpful i love this game its very fun to play in and with friends and family and i love it
__label__helpful its the best ! i have tried the trial but its only <num> minutes . but ! im using my microsoft points to exchange into money for the game : ) its the best ! thank you microsoft rewards for this option and i love minecraft thanks mojang : d
__label__helpful i love minecraft . i never thought i would until my friend got me addicted to it . since then i have been looking for a version to play on my tablet . since ive upgraded to windows <num> i have since then downloaded and have played it on my days off continuously . if i didnt know any better id say my boyfriend was a bit jealous of this game .
__label__helpful i love minecraft , but i hate that you cant mod this version . can someone tell my why all my worlds go corrupt at some point ? i have enough space for several worlds , after a couple hours at most of playing , a world goes corrupt and i lose everything , so i have to export and reload every few minutes , and even then its still as bad .
__label__helpful if you own the minecraft pc version , you can get this for free . works with mcpe worlds and is easy to get textures for . great app overall .
__label__helpful game never crashes now and im on xbox <num> so ignore the fortnite playing haters .
__label__helpful i know i love minecraft on all versions so i know i will like this one . but it wont let me download this ! it stops at acquiring liscence an then says try that again . i click see details and it says the error code is <num> x <num> f <num>
__label__unhelpful fortnite is laggier than subnautica . i get that its a big game and there are gonna be bugs , but the lag is unbearable . if you get to a building and you get a gun , you might encounter another player . that player might have a gun . if you want to kill the player , you will increase your chances of the kill if you fire first . but if lag comes in you might lose . the lag is issued by player , so it will hit you in short bursts .
__label__unhelpful love the fact that you can shoot threw wood how fun
__label__helpful this is an incredibly smooth running almost bug free game . and probably one of the bests , if not the only best , app on this app store .
__label__helpful i first got this app when it first came out on my iphone , then it came out on here so i got it , its just like pocket edition . i love everything about this game an it is coming to be more and more like pc all the time , <num> stars , best game ive ever played ! p . s . you can play with pocket edition users on their phone and get on servers !
__label__helpful worth the wait and cant wait for the full release <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the game is complete trash . poor player base and mechanics .
__label__helpful now even though the desktop version will always be the best , this is the way to go with the feel that windows <num> is taking on . nicely done !
__label__helpful this game was the experience of being in the wildlife . in a diffirent . and blocky simulation . create your dreamworld or make a house of your liking ! [without cement ! ] either discover the nether . fight diffirent creatures . or the challenging place of minecraft . the end . home of the ender dragon . this is where mostly endermen come from . create your dream world . or play with your mcpe friends . and make your likings out of creative mode . survive in the forest and from punching a tree to the happy ending in survival mode . the next page is yours .
__label__helpful great game for all ages ! the w <num> version of minecraft runs a lot smoother and snappier than the original . once redstone and other blocks are brought in , this could be the goto version of minecraft for many !
__label__helpful just like pe , it is the same except for windows <num> and that really great because . <num> . compatible with mcpe , <num> . has pc gui . it is essentially mcpe but with pc gui ! hope you found this helpful : p !
__label__unhelpful there seems to be some kind of fps problem even though my pc should be able to handle any game i throw at it . i can tell its not <num> .
__label__unhelpful the game has cheaters and bots dont play or you will lose money like me i lost <num> dollars i wanna to give to a friendly player but when i died to this bot player <num> i had <num> cent left i hate this game . i want my <num> dollars and my game fixed .
__label__unhelpful fortnite is a very good battle royale game . theres one thing i must point out however . i had just noticed that the epic tactical shotgun has been removed . please bring this gun back into fortnite : battle royale .
__label__unhelpful gimme my wasted money back
__label__unhelpful best game ever all you haters are just trash at the game
__label__helpful i own it on pc and i love this game . but on xbox it sucks controls are clunky , games are laggy , servers drop to often . graphics suck . save your money and play fortnite
__label__unhelpful i bought the game an it dont even work . biggest waste of money
__label__unhelpful runs like trash . waste of $ <num>
__label__helpful i wish that i could buy the skins but i dont have minecoins . what if we got an allowance so we can buy items but dont have to actually pay for it ?
__label__unhelpful i bought the game on sale in the microsoft store , with season pass and <num> year gold . but they didnt give me game coins it said they will come with !
__label__unhelpful the java edition is brilliant and there was no need to change it other than to lock it onto windows .
__label__helpful i like the game . but i own year <num> pass and the content is unavailable ingame . also i made additional ingame purchases and they too are unavailable . as you can imagine i am very displeased with these difficulties and i do hope this is addressed . this is currently my favorite game and i just want what i purchased(months ago . )
__label__helpful i think that fortnite should have <num> stars not <num> . this game is way over hyped its mediocre at best , its very repetitive , and its boring when you play by yourself . one more thing , all of the customization stuff is too expensive , even though the game is free its still not worth emptying your pockets for a stupid skin that looks cool , the legendary skins cost $ <num> which equals <num> , <num> vbucks . its slightly fun when youre playing with friends . i would not recommend to anyone .
__label__unhelpful everytime i start the game it crashes
__label__unhelpful i like minecraft , its my favorite game . but <num> . <num> is coming out soon and you are still on <num> . <num> or <num> . <num> . please your just adding commands , at minecon they are adding lamas and evil villagers . come on people , minecraft is a very popular game and i know you make a lot of money from it . i hope this does not offend you in any way .
__label__helpful no game chat yet , and customization is decent . controls arent as clunky anymore . frame rate is better . it crashes occasionally . still fun . cant wait to see it develop more . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful title says it all , battlegrounds looked more interesting than this .
__label__helpful i love this game , especially how you can cross platforms . i would give this <num> stars if i could . this game is extra awesome since the <num> . <num> . <num> update came out . thanks so much for this update mojang ! keep it up !
__label__helpful blows all other fps games away . it keeps you coming back for more .
__label__helpful i like mojang very much but i dilike the traders
__label__helpful yea surpise a pc port game runs kind of bad ! everysingle one does ! it even runs bad on the x . well , overtime it will improve and be better . you cant be so quick to diss it . and people please dont hate it bc you cant play it , servers go down that doesnt mean it sucks . i bet in a few months or less this game will run great look better and be fun as hell . so before you rate it bad or tell your friends it sucks give it time . let it mature into a game like no other .
__label__unhelpful every <num> in the reviews saying the game is trash are just mad cause they suck . epic has done an amazing job keeping this game balanced and they release something in the game thats broken or o . p . they quickly patch and balance it . keep it up epic . yall are always gonna have haters cause no matter how good some <num> is there is always some <num> better . so instead of taking the l like and going on with their lives , they get salty and blame it on epic
__label__unhelpful you get to kill people and i dont like it you die
__label__unhelpful trash garbage trash garbage shield+shield+shield+shotgun with sniper accuracy trash trash trash trash zero balance . game makes no sense . teammates are worthless . ubisoft is nothing but a bunch of foreign . and as for the division . pretty much same thing . oh and zero servers not worth the money no ubisoft game ever is .
__label__helpful best multiplayer ive seen on xbox ever
__label__helpful probably my favorite fps to date and the developers are constantly updating the game to keep it fair and balanced . on the other hand this is by far the bugiest fps ever , you will come across them often when you play this game , which is especially upsetting during ranked play , but by far the worst thing is the crashes , which occur most of all . these things dont stop me from playing , its still an amazing game , but with all the bugs and no real campaign it just cant be a <num> .
__label__helpful i used to really like this game but its so frustrating after awhile with all the lag bugs dont this game not worth the money this stinks on the computer as well just avoid this game at all cost i played the full release of it and they have a battle pass like fortnite and its still broke
__label__helpful the game is fine but remember this game cannot be linked with your mojang account . just letting people know this in case that was their plan .
__label__unhelpful the game is getting constant updates with active server communities ! this is a really worth game getting .
__label__helpful i would pay $ <num> for this for the current pvp . vehicles and a biggerenlarged map would be sweet in the future . but this is still in beta state . the devs said bigger maps are coming and they are working on a way for vehicles to fit in . download this game ignore all the bad reviews . if bugs are out they are quick to fix . <num> quick updates in the past couple days and now its running smoother than butter .
__label__helpful im new to the game and its good but its unplayable cause over these three days that ive been playing ive been intentionally team killed damn near every match or every other . if i could get my money back i would , what waste when this game has so much to offer . i dont even want to talk about the sexual harassment and racist things being said in game
__label__unhelpful i originally got this game because i thought i could join some servers with my friends , that was not the case due to the fact that minecraft windows <num> cannot connect to any of their servers ! i really enjoy the game , believe me i do but , its a big let down that i just paid almost <num> dollars on a game i cannot play with my friends . i would love to get a refund because this is ridiculous but i honestly dont think they give them and i cannot buy the java version due to having no money to do so . do not buy if you want to play with friends !
__label__helpful although there are alot of bugs and glitches that can make the game frustrating sometimes its an overall great game thats even better with friends and it requires strategic gameplay that decides the way your match is gonna go , also there is no need to buy any of the season passes since ive played this game for <num> months now and have bought all the characters with renown( in game currency) which is alot more fun than spending real life money on something you can easily get . peace & thx for reading ! ✌
__label__helpful probably the most toxic game ive played . the community is <num> x more toxic than the minecraft community when the better together update came out . if you dont own a skin then your considered a noob which isnt right . shotguns literally do <num> damage to the head while your enemy one taps you with <num> damage . jetpacks make the player impossible to hit . the lag is atrocious and needs to be fixed because people can shoot through walls . when season <num> came the whole game began to fall apart but the developers dont care about the acual problems they only care about adding new skins and weapons so they can trick <num> year olds into stealing their moms credit card so epic can fill up their wallet . if you havent installed this game dont its not worth your time to download this awful game that leeched its success from pubg
__label__helpful im not necessarily the biggest minecraft fan out there , but this game seems very built , and moving away from the lousy java version was the best thing microsoft could have done . keep it up ! update : i have been playing more minecraft lately , for xbox one and pc , in addition to w <num> , and although they have a lot more features right now , i think that this version has the greatest potential , since it is a universal app . im sure microsoft is working to bring more features to this version , we just have to be patient .
__label__helpful its too fast and raided by <num> year olds
__label__helpful ive got an extra standard edition if someone wants it
__label__helpful super fun battle royale mode , but they need to add a killcam or at least a variation of a killcam . because sometimes when i die i want to see how they did it
__label__helpful all the people who rate <num> stars are just salty that the game is hard its fun to if u actully go to play for fun with strat rulet
__label__unhelpful this game is the best ! <emoji> but their are some mistakes but this game is very addicting
__label__unhelpful i didnt like anything youve done to this version . the design . the features . and the marketplace .
__label__helpful make save the world free
__label__helpful i love the fact that you can create almost anything and make large oceans of water yourself . i wish that they had smaller sizes for blocks , outer space , and more variety of items that could be crafted . the blocks are to big to be realistic and you cant do very much with them if you are being specific in the craft , but other than that its a great game . i recommend it to others .
__label__helpful fix the game crashing its very frustrating
__label__unhelpful dose , t give commands when i type something in its says error ; command not found i put first to add cheat please please !
__label__helpful i love this game because you can do differnet kinds of stuff and when it updates it puts differnet kinds of things
__label__helpful is too random and is a pubg copy , about <num> of the game is action , most of it is loading and walking lol
__label__unhelpful i hate this game . the game is play to win , people who have the battle pass always win which gives them the upper advantage over other players . the in game store is so expensive , $ <num> for a player , pickaxe , and glider skin . dont get it because its really horrible .
__label__helpful trying to milk money from little kids . only provides to casual fanbase , not the competitive fans . recommend if yyou are under <num> <emoji> . but if you are above that age i dont recommend .
__label__unhelpful when i try to play with others in a lan party . for some reason it doesnt allow for us to share a world without having internet . i will be able to see there host world and try to connect to it , but when i do it sits there saying something like looking for server and then it times out saying it cant connect to it . i am pretty sure that the host is the server , so this shouldnt be an issue . although when i am connected to a network with internet it works fine . i can see their host world and join with no problem . currently we are doing this between the android and the windows <num> version . if you could fix this i would give it a straight up <num> stars .
__label__unhelpful the graphics and i dont like is that you cannot change your appearance of your character
__label__helpful it is a little behind the java version but frequent updates get it closer and closer . the performance and view distance of the game is super ! way better than the java version . i love the cross play with the mobile versions . a few more updates and this will be my favorite minecraft version . aah , who am i kidding . it already is !
__label__unhelpful between very little mod support , a lack of supporting saves and worlds , and so little information on what i actually got being presented truthfully , honestly the worst thing i have ever spent money on . i hope microsoft realizes theyve dropped the ball with this mess of a release , but considering its essentially the same game being sold again , and its microsoft , i feel as if theyll continue to milk minecraft as an ip as much as they possibly can for as much money as they possibly can .
__label__unhelpful why do people not like this game
__label__helpful ubisoft has done it again ! siege has captured the absolute essence of the rainbow six franchise and presents the player with fastpaced , tactical , <num> v <num> , closequarters , roundbased combat . the game offers a staggering variety of operators and gadgets that complements nearly every style of gameplay and skill set imaginable and has an almost perfect balance between attacked and defenders resulting in highly competitive rounds when matched with other likeskilled players . ubisofts commitment to the game , to date , had been unwavering , offering frequent updates for bug fixes and fresh content each season in the form of new operators , new maps , as well as rebalancing of legacy operators to ensure no single breaking operator exists . new players will potentially feel a little intimidated at first given the sheer amount of content in game but will quickly come up to speed . if youre looking for a game that has a perfect blend of strategy , tactics , and plan execution , youve found it !
__label__helpful just took away the <num> stars to <num> star , now back to <num> stars ! the progress they are making to let the pewx editions catch up with the pc version is coming along nicely ! still no command prompt . : (
__label__helpful great game ! only problem is how toxic people are so its best to play with a full squad of friends or make looking for group post stating not to tk
__label__helpful i enjoy playing minecraft with my oldest daughter . this version makes it easy . just wish it had more options . still a great start ,
__label__helpful this game runs as good as stephen hawking walks
__label__helpful i pay all most $ <num> bucks and when i got on it said unlock full game it sucks ! : ( : (
__label__unhelpful you are better off getting the pc version which include this edition for free . at first glance , this is no different than the version on my phone which was less than $ <num> . have not been able to associate this with a mojang account . the game that was downloaded and installed (and paid for) is unplayable except in demo mode . this has been much more of a headache than i would expect for close to $ <num> .
__label__helpful its so much fun its my number one favorite ! i cant stop playing ! some of my favorite things are mining and crafting ! ive played it before and its awesome ! i like survival but creative is fun too i use it to build houses and make towns and stores , librarys , it passes time and its much more enjoyable then other games ever made !
__label__helpful i got this for free from owning the pc version , and for the price it isnt bad . keep in mind it is still a beta , but i think it has a lot of potential , the tabletlike ui is just a starting point . the biggest selling point for me is that it runs on microsofts new directx <num> . the potential performance improvements are astronomical . simply the fact that it runs on a native windows library and not jvm should spell out huge performance improvements . i hope they update it to include full pc features , but for now , its good . i look forward to seeing what it looks like out of the beta .
__label__helpful the game can be fun and challenging with friends , but <num> of the community is toxic . teamkills and bad sportsmanship galore . fun game with friends , a test in sanity and patience otherwise
__label__unhelpful i hate it cant install it .
__label__helpful ive always loved minecraft and i love minecraft windows <num> edition because you can play with an xbox controller a pc keyboard or touchscreen . love the addons because its just like mods except way easier ! the only thing i dont like is not having stained glass but otherwise great !
__label__unhelpful cant even load in , just keeps saying cant connect . not a good start
__label__unhelpful well the fact that it allows json addons makes it a tiny bit better , but you can only do basic stuff in json such as change mob health and stuff like that . i wish you were allowed to make mods in c (or java or c++) . on top of that , mods in minecraft deskop edition (exe version) is what got me into code in the first place . i learned java and started making mods for mc in java .
__label__unhelpful i cant believe how bad this game is . just play fortnite for free . it runs smoother , looks better , loads faster .
__label__helpful ive been playing for a long time and all i can say is wow ! the game is amazing . i recommend it to casual to hard core gamers . the game never gets repetitive and its always fun , except when you get spawn killed . the <num> problem (i should say <num> problems) is that there is no story mode , its just multiplayer and terrorist hunt , which you can play solo and play with up to <num> friends (unless you play custom game then you can play with up to <num> friends) , also their are some bugs and glitches , but most have been patched up by our awsome developers and will continue to be patched . <num> more really cool thing if your not sure if your going to buy it all dlcs (downloadable content) are free , however the catch to this is that the characters you have to buy . (hold on to your horses ! ) you can buy them with real money which is $ <num> . <num> dollars a character or you can buy them with the in game currency which is <num> , <num> renown which you get fairly fast , or you could buy the seasons pass which is $ <num>
__label__unhelpful initially i had download store error but it seems like they fixed it . plays great hard to play on controller . hit box on animals seem a little off . please bare in mind that windows <num> platform includes surface , desktop and windows <num> phones . minecraft windows <num> edition is made with surfaces in mind(minecraft pe) overall great job .
__label__unhelpful i have been waiting ages for certain features to be included and they still are not
__label__unhelpful man ! this game is great yes the v bucks are totally over priced but no said u have <num> buy them . those people who are all like fort nte sucks r just up set because they suck . the game is a great game its very unique <emoji> plus its free just try it if u dont like it delete . it <emoji>
__label__unhelpful its a shooty game and its a good game to become a school shooter
__label__helpful i love everything about the game every game is different its all exciting and challenging . there is some freezing glitches and graphic bugs that need to be addressed but other that the game is a nice change of pace compared to all the other run and gun shooters .
__label__unhelpful its a copy of pubg the map is like <num> times smaller than pubg
__label__unhelpful after i selected full screen mode the game just stopped working . ive tried leaving and coming back into it but it just freezes right away . plz fix
__label__helpful the purchase screen said it was compatible with xbox one and would begin downloading , but it never did . very disappointed in this garbage version of minecraft , i already have the original pc version and only wanted this one for the xbox .
__label__helpful i have had pubg since release and played it on both xbox one s and the xbox one x and have had it installed on a <num> gb ssd and the game still has major issues that i think will never be fixed because the game is a pc port and needs to be remade for consoles like the xbox one ! the game runs so bad on the xbox <num> x that im waiting for call of duty blackout and especially battlefields ring of fire and see battle royal run on the frostbite engine with total destruction and both will run at <num> fps at <num> p while pubg can barely hit <num> fps at <num> p if competition doesnt make pubg better nothing will ! if they cant get pubg better then they need to sell it to a professional developer !
__label__helpful loot boxes are terrible <num> . <num> of the time you get the same crap that alone takes some reward away from playing . skins and other add ons are way over priced for as awful as they look equipped need to add more gun camo to just buy out right besides grinding till <num> to finally unlock a new one and stop making us pay <num> for <num> full outfit are you stupid it should be free for playing this sh for this long and hardly any change they are just greedy seeing the lack of players since black out they went to gamepass for a last ditch effort to make money from microtransactions while this game still lies in ruin from rubberbanding , framerate drops , rounds not sufficiently hitting targets , cars flipping and or flying through the sky after hitting objects the wrong way , crashes , getting stuck at load screens when the game starts , getting stuck in your chute , or running into invisible walls on rooftops , stick to the reviews because at this rate they wont have this game running right for the next <num> yr
__label__helpful this game contains <num> rainbows very disappointing
__label__helpful ps <num> and xb <num> can now cross play
__label__helpful shameful rip off of pubg packed with gimmicks that cater only to luck and crappy players . cant win a firefight ? build some walls or hop around vigorously . cant aim ? spam rockets and grenades . cant figure out where to go ? the maps tiny so dont worry . dont have an attention span ? thats ok theres very little content compared to games like pubg . also always rewards luck over skill . you could die the second your feet hit the ground because the other guys landing spot had something and yours didnt or you could make it to last two people with <num> + kills and get blown up by a camping <num> year old with a lucky blind rocket shot . it is free , and kinda playable but you get what you pay for .
__label__unhelpful <num> nd match i ever played and people tried to team kill me lol good bye <emoji> ✌
__label__helpful stop updating its making the game worse
__label__unhelpful its a survivalist version for sure . if you need mods , instant map cords , safe save points , and all that other little kid creative junk then go play the original . this is for the big boys . love the way everything is fixed as far as game mode and achievements . this way the real survivalists can say they did it with no modcheat help because the game disables all the achievements if you kiderizecreative mode it . once the realms are added . yes . we will separate the real gamers from the sandboxers .
__label__unhelpful bs got it as a gift wish i could return or exchange it . gave a chance for almost a month even with updates game is over hyped and trash and yes i do realize its in preview but it just makes me rage more than im having fun . dont waste your time and money
__label__helpful i love this game because it is creative and fun for all ages
__label__helpful minecraft is so much fun , doesnt matter what your age is . a friend shared this game with me years ago so seeing the changes and new content over time is exciting and allows for more creativity yet stays true to its pixels . the only bug so far is not being able to simultaneously change direction while flyingwalking at random times , like dino crisis , you have to adjust your direction before moving . still love it .
__label__helpful i think the windows <num> edition is good , with the new update it is good . but if you added in command blocks , pistons etc . this would be my favourite
__label__helpful gameplays a little laggy . the interactions are slow . the textures look rough .
__label__unhelpful f this game str <num> up game is wack
__label__helpful game can be really fun a times especially with friends . but since its early access there are tons of problems . if you havent gotten the game yet , hold out until the game is better optimized , and bugs been been fixed .
__label__helpful i absolutely love this game ! anyone who hates on it just cant appreciate that it is a work in progress . bugs and issues are all just things you signed up for by buying a preview . developers know the issues and are constantly trying to updatefix them . if you are a whiner you probably just blow at the game . pubg is awesome and i am excited for the future content to come ! buy this game and become an addict like myself . hitmewithawarriorcrate pubgtillthedeathofme
__label__unhelpful dont buy this garbage can its not ready yet crashes like <num> times in <num> game <emoji> zebi wsayi
__label__helpful once the cross platforming capability that was discussed and promised is implemented i will gladly and happily give this game a <num> star rating . the cross platforming that i am talking about is xbox one and windows <num> . that capability is the main reason for purchasing this game . ive already bought the xbox <num> edition , then the xbox one edition since i updated consoles , to be honest i feel a bit ripped off to have to purchase the game yet again but did it willingly because its a good game and i can (or so i thought) play with my kids in the evening time . a little insight would be of great help here . ill be waiting
__label__unhelpful hey pls make it free because there are <num> people are waiting to download but you need to give them space by making the game free for people pls we gave you million support now its time for you guys to give it us and i am not trying to get any kind ok take back . iam thinking ok people who are in the world suffering without the game because their parents wont give them money to buy . pls make it free then you guys will get more downloads
__label__helpful game is really fun with friends , but often crashes or lags . also graphics problems sometimes . it needs more updates too to fix these issues , otherwise its ok
__label__helpful this game is great ! i love how i can set my own goals for the game and create whatever i want . very addictive ! the only problem im experiencing is that the game will often freeze and close on itself (usually when i look at my map) . im not sure if this is because of my pc or not , but ive seen other persons reviews explaining how they experience this same problem . other than that , well made and fun !
__label__helpful this game is addicting af , it never gets boring because its a different experience every single match . its a very fun game with friends , but also when you go lone wolf . one thing i dont like about the game is the ranked mode is still in beta , but thats pretty much it . i would definitely recommend this if you like tactical and very addicting games : )
__label__unhelpful the game needs mods . i think this game would be much better if we could us mods . thanks notch
__label__unhelpful porly designed and there seems to be no management . quit what your doing a make paperclips instead . fuall
__label__helpful i like how it has a bit of its own taste to it from the other platforms and how it has a few interesting features like how zombie villagers show their own profession but one thing i do not like too much is that in game , most of the interface is to much like pocket edition besides the crafting table .
__label__helpful it runs far better on both my windows <num> gaming pc and windows <num> tablet , and is far more visually appealing than the normal java version of minecraft . its also much more touchscreenfriendly , but its missing key advanced video and control settings , as well as having some buggy mechanics like clickanddragging in the inventory , and strafing while running . overall its very good for a beta and will provide enjoyable gameplay , even with its downfalls . recommended
__label__unhelpful <num> fps hot garbage xb <num> x seventeen didnt i just buy a <num> <emoji> console to not experience <num> fps ?
__label__helpful repetitive and boring same thing every match
__label__helpful i am a fan of minecraft and i think this app would make you addicted to the game . have fun !
__label__helpful this game is great you can play as the koolaids man , a dorito , gosh even a god <emoji> to name a few but beware of toxic teams .
__label__helpful pump headshot does <num> <emoji>
__label__helpful i like this game because it gives people another way to play minecraft together , like having xbox live support , crossplatform between pe and win <num> , and lan . while still not having some features , new updates are rolled out relatively quickly . i would strongly recommend this game for users used to pe , and as well as pcmac player , for they get this for free . also , the new updates bring relatively the same features as the pc version , at the same time . very few and minor bugs .
__label__helpful i didnt pay <num> usd to get killed my a <num> year on my team but when i kill him i get temp banned for <num> hours ? thats like buying a broken disc fix your game
__label__helpful glitchy as heck . but , still a fun game .
__label__unhelpful i love this game truly . but since hibana and echo were added , ive been dissapointed . i meaan hibanas great . but can you tell me what the point of echo is ? every map seems like its made to his disadvantage , especially the new one . you cant bring the drone outside at all and you arent even allowed to scan enemies with it . his gun sucks and the only good thing about him is that he looks cool . and on top of that , his yokai is horrible . you have to be so precise in order for it to work and it deosnt recharge fast enough . either he needs to be removed or the maps need to be updated . and i found a bug with frost . it was on bank and i jumped through one of the windows and destroyed the bear trap , it gave me the <num> points , and then i got downed with a bear trap on me somehow . fix it
__label__helpful it appears that microsoftmojang has discovered and fixed the auto crash bug that was keeping this from opening consistently . fun to play , but im unable to see the realm that im already a member of . great improvements , but still room to grow .
__label__helpful the game is good , if it doesnt crash , which it doesnt for me . and if it does , well , its free , so its not like you wasted money on it . also , being bad at the game is not an excuse for making a bad review saying theres too many tryhards and unbalanced weapons .
__label__unhelpful i have <num> words this game sucks
__label__unhelpful chơi bản free rất hay nên mình đã mua game này để chơi với bạn bè , không tiếc <num> . <num> vnd để mua , game quá hay
__label__helpful after the windows <num> creators update minecraft crashes on launch . i get the mojang logo , and then poof , nothing . all the drivers are up to date , the game is up to date , and zero help from microsoft . their solution is to do a clean install of windows <num> and then when that doesnt work , i am supposed to uninstall all my programs and then try reinstalling them one at a time until i find the problem . yeah , see , i have over <num> tb of games and programs on this machine and deleting them would require <num> hours of downloads to get them all back . thats twoandahalf weeks of letting my computer sit their and do nothing but download to fix a problem that i didnt have before the update screwed everything up . also , not a fan of how every time the game client updates i get giant chunks of my map moved around . nothing makes your jungle base look better than a <num> brick high , <num> brick long chunk of random biome where my farm used to be .
__label__helpful love the game , but since the recent i cant even play it . the game will load up and get to the menu , then the screen will just turn black out of nowhere and go back to my xbox home screen . can yall fix it please ?
__label__helpful this game has one of the worst communities ive ever seen , teamkilling and some serious poor sports . i have put over <num> hours into this game and have experienced nothing but whiners , but i still play cause i love the game itself . but if you cant deal with toxic gamers , dont buy , sadly this game is full of them .
__label__helpful i purchased this game twice . once on xbox and once on pc . i signed into my epic games account on booth , but was unable to play on pc . i contacted support , got on their forums , posted multiple times , <num> emails so far . first they ignored me . then they started sending me excuses instead of making it right . the excuse , you have to make a new account that is not linked to xbox in order to play . fine , i can do that , but wait , you still cant play because it was purchased on another account . ok , so give be a code for a new copy that i can play . nope . more excuses and saying i have to buy it a third time . they keep blaming xbox instead of making it right . horrible support and bad business ethics .
__label__helpful game has tons of operators to choose from , making it alot more fun . but dont really like how it says <num> v <num> or <num> v <num> . ect . if that were taken away it would increase the rate at which the element of suprise is available . and being able to see teammates through walls has really proved helpful . i love the game . i suggest you buy it . if your into fast paced , strategic , and realistic games .
__label__unhelpful minecraft on pc has already grown tremendously and this seems like a huge set back towards all the progress . it is like pocket edition which isnt that good in my opinion with more blocks . also wish the controls were changeable because it is hard to reach ctrl if you are using a normal keyboard rather than a gaming keyboard .
__label__unhelpful this is a fantastic game but what i want to know is why i dont also own the mobile version of the app multi platform is useless if i have to buy the same game twice . please fix and i will rate five stars
__label__helpful missing a lot of features , but its beta , something that a lot of people around here seem to forget . ive owned the game since its alpha days and was pleased to see a free code for the windows <num> version here . the first thing youll notice is that the game isnt running in the old java client , which is already a good first step . i hope to see more features added to this version besides the intended vanilla features , perhaps we can get some crossplatform multiplayer going on with xbox one ? many of the negative reviews i see complain about inapp purchases (limited to skins , but you still have the option to import your own skins for free) and even more of the negative reviews treat this game as a finished product . again , this is beta . its an unfinished product . it says beta in the title , but lets be honest here . microsoft cant possibly label it large enough for colorful enough to make it obvious to these people that its a work in progress . ignore the <num> star reviews .
__label__helpful im sick of my dlc ops dissapearing and frost shows up in my ready to install , so i install it , and then dlc operators early access goes into my ready to install . update : ive given a <num> star review because there are so many crybaby <num> star reviews for no reason . you didnt lose anything from the season pass ! the season pass covers operators only ! dlc maps are <num> free ! we lost <num> map that could return as theres no way they havent even started working on it yet , and the polish season was replaced with operation health , and put before hk dlc . you still get exactly what you paid for , stop crying kids .
__label__helpful i can only play one round of pubg then it crashes the next . why ?
__label__helpful the game is so addicting i love the guns how realistic the game is when you kill people and the cameras are so o . p . but a <emoji> is that theres friendly fire i mean i like the fact there trying to make it like real life but theres lots of jerks out there that wont hezitate to kill u
__label__helpful fortnite used to be aa good game (season <num> and half of season <num> ) and its not even about skill pumps do no damage and noobies end up get the best loot and can kill you easy atlest add it to where we are ranked in so we get people on our skill level and not firstgame noobs or console ninjamyth if were not on that skill level
__label__helpful the game requires patience and without it , your going to be punished . while very unforgiving , you always find yourself itching for more . it provides a very unique gaming especially on consoles . all of the one stars are from people who cant even get one kill a match . the first two weeks of this game are going to be painful but once you understand the game mechanics things are going to much more satifying . definitely worth a buy .
__label__unhelpful i need vbucks and refunds
__label__helpful minecraft is still a very fun game and the addition of the better together update really makes playing with friends easy and fun !
__label__helpful this game is really just an awesome game . only one thing , split screen . there needs to be a local co op then <num> star .
__label__unhelpful this should be for ffrreeee
__label__helpful i highly recommend this game it is free updates every week different game everytime you play it
__label__unhelpful very addictive , super fun , worth your money , some glitches though
__label__unhelpful overall great game and good price , although it could use a little work on the map lag but it isnt that bad considering it just released
__label__unhelpful you know that one dead bug in your screen door that you try to ignore , thats fortnite
__label__unhelpful i think i would enjoy this game a lot more if i could play it . at the moment it cant even download . so can it please be fixed asap !
__label__unhelpful the battlepass was not worth it
__label__unhelpful the game just freezes then boots you out
__label__helpful the game is very fun an addicting . i cant wait until they add even more .
__label__helpful game has been out half a year and is just getting worse and worse . no hope for this poor excuse of a game .
__label__unhelpful never got a chance to play bc the wont launch . pubg doesnt have these issues . fortnite !
__label__helpful they have added so much but the game still needs more weapons and mounts . im really impressed with what they are doing and have done but please add more . it is <num> dollars after all
__label__helpful having to hold x to reload sucks
__label__unhelpful i don like that the update dosent have new animals like goats , horses better horses @ least evey thing eles is cinda good but you could use more villages in this world that are easy to find and here are some more villages here are some more animals that you could possibly add to the next update goats , turtles whales live fish , whales so basicly see creatures and cheates diraffes , hipoes , and safarie animals , more wiled animals
__label__helpful dont get me wrong its a good game but i bought the founders pack and i was almost to the end of the tutorial i encountered glich the mini llamas dont work . plz someone dont waste your time getting save the world . but please fix it .
__label__helpful the windows <num> edition pocket edition is still a bit behind the ol java version regarding mechanics and content , but not by all that much . for a vanilla experience , the win <num> edition is a very easy way to play : great performance , littletono technical issues .
__label__helpful this runs much more smoothly than the java version . obviously the first beta version is barely different from pocket edition (which it is ported from) , but well quickly see improvements . one such example of this is in the gui for the survival inventory , crafting table , and stone cutter . they resemble the pc version more than pocket edition . if they do similar things for the other guis , like the furnace and chests , it will be much better . there are optimizations to the gui in general that they could make , but its hard to say in the first beta what they will change . there are many complaints about redstone (which isnt in pocket edition yet , so theyll have to add it to this version separately) , and a bunch of little complaints about things that they will hopefully change . i expect huge updates in the near future that greatly increase the playability of this version . go easy on the reviews . this was just released to public beta .
__label__helpful i usually play the java version of minecraft because of the features and mods , but this version (c++) is still fun and runs great on mobile devices . i had minecraft pe on my iphone and ipad but it is great to have this version on my surface pro and desktop . there is cross platform play so you can join servers with people playing on ios or android oss . the game is similar to the java version in many aspects and different in others . i understand it is meant for mobile and therefore there is a lack of graphics settings , except from fast to fancy , but since they are pushing this with windows <num> , many people have powerful gaming pcs and would like to change the settings to take advantage of their hardware . i would recommend this game and if you already own the java version then it is free , just sign into you mojang account on their website and enter your code in the windows store . not a replacement for java minecraft but definitely worth trying out !
__label__helpful the devs are pathetic . <num> updates and its still unplayable . og xbox gamer can shoot through unrendered surfaces . the game crashes every other game . the gun fights are inconsistent . the lag and framerate is horrendous . your settings constantly get reset . matchmaking takes forever . the loot is pathetic and you only get duplicates . avoid this game . worst game ever made .
__label__helpful pubg had great potential , and could have easily been a <num> star game , but it doesnt live up to the hype . for starters , the crashing . it is inevitable , no matter how good your console runs , this game will crash at the worst times . then theres the movement . its spotty , laggy , and can have you running in place for minutes at a time as you try to grab one item . then theres solo mode . solo mode is alright up until you hit the top <num> , then everyone is just driving around trying to get a splatter kill . i payed $ <num> for pubg , not an updated buggier version of carmegeddon . the game still has loads of potential , but as of right now , save yourself some time and frustration , and buy a different game . pubg needs time to develop further .
__label__unhelpful i dont like the tier system and it sucks and the coomunity are justt trolls and just the whole game !
__label__unhelpful dont waste your money on this sh@t .
__label__unhelpful good game but servers are horrible
__label__unhelpful pubg reigns superior this game is for children
__label__helpful make a <num> v <num>
__label__unhelpful in app purchases , forced tabletmobile user interface , and no sync with online mojang settings (skins) . overall , a very poor cash grab effort
__label__unhelpful game crashes more than stevie wonder trying to drive
__label__helpful sucks , lag lag lag and disconnect . you battle the game not the players .
__label__unhelpful the game suddenly freezes your character when in battle every now and then , then your dead . fix this issue and multiple others . this game is broken and the people who play are just annoying . well your just playing your game and you have all good loot you might just come across a bush camper or someone using a double pump the most broken thing ever . pump do alot of damage but there are those times where you hit a guy for <num> damage and he one shots you . sooooo many problems must be fixed in order for a decent game . sorry epic , i love your games and all but theres just something about this one that gets me . <emoji> oh and lower the vbucks prices <num> $ for <num> thing is disappointing . now i come back and update this after <num> weeks and its just disappointing . i have friends i play with me we all have the same glitch where we cant pull out our gun ! its annoying ! when im landing and some other player decides to land next to me i pick up my weapon try to pull it out , nothing happens . im done .
__label__unhelpful for the love of god take the desert map off desync is awful , now with latest patch everything on the xbox one x is darker and the brightness o nly turns the constrast up and does nothing towards the dark spots everywhere on both maps
__label__helpful plz update it faster to <num> . <num>
__label__unhelpful the fact tht u get disconnected constantly
__label__unhelpful deberian dejarnos conectar minecraft con playstation
__label__helpful ditching java is the best thing to ever happen to minecraft . the game is in beta and has some catching up to do , but once its on par with the win <num> version in terms of features this is definitely going to be the version of choice .
__label__unhelpful i logged in to mojang , and it gave me the redeem option . when i clicked on redeem , it told me to login with your microsoft account , which i did , and then it said that it was redeemed , but i never had the option of downloading it for free . the game itself is almost similar to the actual game . there are huge performance boosts , and it kinda reminds me a bit too much of the windows phone version .
__label__helpful <num> )new game concept very fun and addicting ! <num> )overall gameplay is much better and recent updates have helped tremendously . <num> )firing and using weapons in the game take some getting used to . give it time , youll get it down . <num> )having the airplane fly higher in the sky so a larger part of the map could be used each round would be very welcoming . <num> )parachutes auto deploys for you as well at a certain altitude . id like to see that changed . if i want to splat then please let me . <num> ) with all that being said if the right people are working on this game . i believe this game has the potential to be another big seller like the gta series . <num> ) the game only has one map currently . and like most open world games buildings and such are replicated many times in each area so things get old pretty fast .
__label__unhelpful such a bad game it gave me cancer
__label__unhelpful microsoft killed the game . s updates , no mods and changed some mechanic . the game is dying
__label__helpful this was a great game till they broke it time and time again . servers go down almost every week . lazy devs and clearly board as well to let this petty shit happen , the next cockstar in the making . fix you epic
__label__helpful i love to play this game all the time , it lets you funnel out our creativity , being allowed to makebuild pretty much anything your heart desires . it does not lag or crash for me anymore and the new blocks are a great addition ! but i must ask . when are you going to add stained glass ? amazing game , would play forever . ^o^
__label__helpful gun play is fun but its laggy . also it crashes alot ive only gone one with out a crash . so go in with a open mind and youll have fun go in thinking its finished and youll pull your hair out .
__label__unhelpful the interface is terrible for pc . the notyetported touch interface is so painful to use , it almost makes the game unplayable . worst offenders : nonremappable keyboard (not everyone uses wasd , esdf is far superior and ive died because buttons are in the wrong place) , hovertext often doesnt show up or flickers and vanishes too quickly , the inventory will randomly shuffle things around , redstone isnt implemented (which wouldnt bother me so much , but that also means that) you cant make pressure plates to close gates behind you , trading with npcs is broken . theres more . now , it certainly runs better than the java version , sometimes too well ! but without remappable keys its a sad imitation . keys are more important than mods , for me . and faaaaaaaaar more important than mp . what good are other players if i cant even control my character ?
__label__unhelpful this game is so friggin dope ! but just fix the clicheness and the fact i never find people because of that stupid double t tilted towers ! (also add a huge hikingbased mountain place called hikin haywire)
__label__helpful it is a real shame of the new view i can only see half my screen
__label__unhelpful this came preinstalled on my brand new computer . i played the demo and went ahead and purchased the full version since the option was right there . i was unaware that i was not purchasing the java version from mojang . i have attempted to get a refund to no avail . this is trickery and i would like to have the java version to play with my friends , but now i do not have the money to spare . tl ; dr microsoft tricked me into buying the terrible version of minecraft and seems to offer no way of getting a refund .
__label__helpful you cant even play the game without running into a tryhard who no lifes the game everyday <num> hours a day . my friends use to play different games , and talk about actual stuff . now its just i need to get a new cosmetic before my mom grounds me for getting v bucks with her debit card . people non stop play this game to the point where the game isnt fun anymore . they still play it thought to show they can win . the only real objective is to win and get cosmetics . i mean the lag is horrible , there are sweaty people left and right , the game is pretty much pointless , and it is taking away the chance to do other things . now its just fortnite . this is what this generation has come to . just warning you if you get sucked in by this game youre not getting out . save the world is ok but everything else sucks .
__label__helpful pros : simple , quick matches , building , and those spicy astetics . cons : weapon grades , needs more traps , it also needs to expand areas , and it needs to fix hit registration . fyi : to all who say fortnite copied pubg , i just want you to know pubg copied h <num> z <num> so now you know shut up with that nonsense . opinion : overall the game is fun and free so why not give it a try . it has its issues just like any other game but if you compare it to pubg , they both have similar issues except fortnite is free pubg is $ <num>
__label__unhelpful its okay , but pubg is better
__label__helpful i started this game about a week after season <num> started , and instantly fell in love . this game was amazing and fun in every aspect , and then epic started listening to the season <num> and <num> noobs . then next thing you know the shotguns are nerfed , then gathering materials is nerfed and so is editing , double shotty , and wallstructure health . they even increased bloom on most weapons ! then here comes the smgs . this smg meta has torn apart the game more then anything . and the fact that their is no double shotty to counter it is sad , very sad . building is what made this game unique and fun , and it was just about the only skill gap in the game . now it doesnt even matter how fast you build or who is the better builder , its about who has the better smg and who gets lucky with there bloom shots . literally its making games shorter because their is rarely any build fights anymore . not to mention that shotguns are completely garbage now . i am probably gonna start playing realm royale for now on
__label__unhelpful garbage , buildings load slowly and merge your character into them . buy something else .
__label__helpful i bought your colgate toothpaste . and it made me feel like a piece of s .
__label__helpful i used to play minecraft since <num> . many features were added since those days . this game is addictive , beautiful graphics , and its really the best game i have ever played ! i have the original pc edition , windows <num> edition , pocket edition and ps <num> edition , and when the xbox one x comes out , ill have the xbox one edition .
__label__helpful im annoyed at how loud the music cause everytime i log in im blasted by loud music and for the crashes it keeps crashing every time im in a middle of a game with friends and we end up dying because of it and the frame rate keeps going down at random times but the gameplay is good i guess update : still crashes at the worst possible momments
__label__helpful long review ahead . first off there are a lot of cons to this game . the framerate is maybe <num> on xbox one x and even that is a maybe , while it is even worse on the regular xbox one often probably hitting lower than <num> . no matter how good your internet is you will lag at some point , i generally do a lot . the beginning is the worst about lagging which is bad because thats when you need to loot fast . as far as crashing goes ive played around <num> matches and have only crashed once and got right back in since i was in a house , but again im playing on the one x . the game also has a problem with hit detection which is why you can swear you shot someone but nothing happened . i can forgive crashes and lag due to early access but i cant forgive not having the option to play private matches . before anyone shouts early access , full pc version came out recently and only some streamers have the option to create them . why <num> stars then ? gameplay is adrenaline pumping especially if you make top <num>
__label__unhelpful this game will be great once the bugs are fixed , but it is not worth the money yet due to constant crashes and texture issues . wait for full release .
__label__helpful it is a very tactical game and it is very , very fun . there are a variety of characters to play as and every year they add more . teamwork is important and you can squad with friends
__label__helpful update : game has not improved as of <num> , its pure garbage . still rubber banding , frame rate drops , controller input lag , the works . i will never purchase another early access title again after conan then this utter piece of dog excrement . its a shame , i wanted this to be good . early access or not , the game should be playable . wasting <num> or <num> minutes per game gearing up just to have it crash is unacceptable . bad textures , slow control response , lag , glitches , and non stop crashes . if thats how you want to play a game then have at this one . another pile of garbage cash grab (yes cash grab , look how bad it is vs pc) ive placed on the refund list .
__label__unhelpful so i decided to try out the new fullscreen option , where i was met with a frozen game and completely bugged out audio . you cant close the game even with task manager , and once it finally closes your audio will emit an annoying high pitch sound until you restart . once this is fixed i will fix my review .
__label__helpful needs optimization and constant updates . tons of fun . perfect for those that cant stand fortnites cartoonish style
__label__unhelpful not fun and impossible to win
__label__helpful let me start off by saying i know the game is not complete or perfect on xbox . the game crashes and glitches can be frustrating and maddening at times . that being said , the battle royale concept is great . getting to the top <num> makes your heart race , and getting to the final few is a feeling ive never felt in another game . its beyond exhilarating . i love the combination of fps and survival . im glad i bought this and would buy it again .
__label__unhelpful it crashes on the loading screen when i try to start the game up it turns to black screen then takes me back to the home screen
__label__helpful the controls worked fine for me and the game ran perfectly normally (i <num> <num> hq and <num> m) , menus look like theyd work fine with touch (i was using mouse and keyboard) . a few things are inconsistent with the pc version that seem interesting : selecting blocks from the creative menu gives <num> rather than one and you slow down far more quickly in creative flight compared to the pc version . also , quitting the game should be more intuitive . the windows <num> fullscreen app system is relatively new to the average user (me) and at first glance you cant see any way to quit the game correctly until you try to move the mouse to the top (hopefully an easy fix) . aside from that the game is quite playable and the world export feature is very nice .
__label__helpful pros : the building is ok and the guns feel nice cons : missions get boring and just trying to do sidequests get hard and boring and the player base is <num> little kids <num> scammers and <num> who are trying to enjoy this empty game where you have to buy coins or the founder edition just to have good things then gets taken by some scammer so please dont buy this and spend your cash on something else like overwatch or battlefield <num>
__label__helpful fix it or i will proceed to no longer play anything with ubisoft . this game is turning into for honor .
__label__unhelpful this game is not in anyway <num> k ! it out right lies in the description
__label__helpful version . <num> . <num> is out and its an improvement . hope they add more in the coming month or so .
__label__helpful its just like the minecraft pocket edition , except i think its easier to control . the added features in the new update make it difficult to change character perspective , but other than that it handles extremely well and is a very fun game !
__label__helpful i dont understand how this game is popular , i would rather rail my great grandfather with my cock than play this
__label__unhelpful there is no way to learn to play if you are allowed to be killed as soon as you hit the ground . how about giving time to find a weapon or creating a tutorial
__label__unhelpful im on the free trial and iron golems spawn on a village and sooner or later kill me for no reason . i hide in my house but they manage to kill me through walls . weird bug
__label__helpful this game is fun for all ages it makes kids feel happy and even though it is $ <num> it is so worth it
__label__helpful this game is definitely worth buying its great you can build your dream house in creative or survival . you could also just adventure and explore new biomes and get new companions such as wolves and cats . my only compliant is that in the update you cant ride the zombie horses or the skeleton horses and there isnt a variety of colors that you can get when you tame a wolf .
__label__unhelpful i hate playing the game by myself . because every time i get either double , triple , or quad teamed in solo ! it is so inferiating ! and if you are a starting player , it does not care the game will put you up against no lives ! other than that , good quality gameplay , and graphics .
__label__helpful this game is trash . it is a rip off for pubg . its art is bad . the controls are ok but you cant o in first person . those are the major complaints . emotes are boring except for a few . new modes show the brokeness of the game because of balance issues for the people that get the event item . i cannot recommend . i want to try to give it a chance but i just cant . if they fix these , i would give it a chance , but only if they fix them . lag is also bad . my friend lost games because of it .
__label__helpful a game with rare depth , satisfying tactical gameplay that cultivates and rewards teamwork .
__label__helpful input lag , low frame rate , unable to jump from plane , etc .
__label__helpful ranked is still beta after <num> year of being out . headshots tend to not register . constant lagging out and disconnecting . too many diamonds with smurf accounts . fix the servers and hit reg
__label__unhelpful how im finna get better if i get killed before i can practice ? add leagues
__label__helpful epic pls tell your comunetie that no skins have a life
__label__helpful better than fortnite fortnite is trash
__label__unhelpful its just a bad ripoff of pubg
__label__helpful this game is takin over kids lives
__label__unhelpful this is battle front <num> on steriods and its way trashier
__label__unhelpful though the graphics lack a lot the game is a great time killer and gave me a break from world of warcraft .
__label__unhelpful give us everything for free
__label__unhelpful it reminds me of the pocket edition , but this needs windows <num> edition exclusive content
__label__unhelpful its good pugb sucks get good
__label__helpful since update its been running alot better and is fun but still have my issues on a personal level with it but thats just me . its still a clever pvp romper !
__label__helpful this game is beyond amazing and incredibly realistic , right down to the gun fights which turn into a chess match on the fly . thats all it is : one big mind game everytime you spawn in . nothing is done without a reason and these tricks take hours to practice which is what makes this game so amazing , but also its downfall (for new players) . this game is unforgiving if youre clueless , you have to rely on wits and outsmart the enemy at every aspect . aspects such as map knowledge , operators , weaponsequipment , game mechanics , etc . the only way to learn this is to duke it out and keep playing until you get ahead of the curve , and trust me youll feel rewarded when you get it down . all in all , new players : dont let this tough game scare you off , theres just a lot to learn but have patience and youll get it ! (you can always youtube trickstips too lol)
__label__helpful calamity has fat and
__label__helpful i love the look and the borderlands feel i think they should add split screen though overall its awesome also its only <num> dollar for the regular edition !
__label__helpful spawn in get peaked and die . next round get team killed
__label__unhelpful the game needs mods but perfect for ages <num> + the zombies , spiders and skeltons are fine but it needs a little work but for kids it is just fine but you need to remember .
__label__helpful pubg on xbox is alright . the ui is good , controls are good for my preference . there are some things that should be fixed . first is the crashing . it happens every couple games and can be annoying , i understand the game is in preveiw and needs fixes . <num> nd is rendering , i understand that there are <num> people on big server but people that have the xbox one x have a advantage . there are more small things that should be changed .
__label__helpful beta is beta and thats ok but you should be able to interact with chests and crafting stations in creative and console commands need to be added . i love the sound track but at times it seems a bit to intense like im in a fight but im not . maybe they could add a combat theme . idk but its great so far keep up the good work . : )
__label__helpful i like this game but it is missing my favorite decoration : armor stands . never mind they just added them !
__label__unhelpful dis game doo doo nah jk love it keep it up epic
__label__helpful this game has never disappointed me , beautiful performance on all devices and an overall amazing game ! totally worth the purchase if youre into building and are a creative mind . but i recommend this for everyone . remember , dont just give up at the start , take time to get into the game . it brings great things .
__label__helpful pls add the of fps on settings ok !
__label__unhelpful i left a review months ago complaining about how i paid for coins and i didnt get them , but that doesnt matter anymore because i cant update the game and i have to purchase it again for me to do that . everytime i try to view the game on the windows store , it crashes and exits the store . it wants me to purchase the game again , although i had already purchased it . please help me because i cant play the game , and it bothers me . im not sure if its something wrong with my account or my billing info or if its the store , but please help me .
__label__unhelpful that is all this is a strip and rebuild of the original game crafted by microsoft so that mods bring in nothing but revenue for microsoft . i play the original version way more than this one . in fact the only time i play this version is when my kids are playing it and i have too . microsoft should have just built on the original model and went from there . they have not even attempted too improve the graphics or the user interface to make it easier to create mods . microsoft+minecraft=destruction of the series .
__label__unhelpful this is literally just minecraft : pocket edition with a few touchups . the control options in the settings still have lefty and split controls which do nothing , as they are designed for a touchscreen phone . this is meant to be played on a pc , so why would you port a smartphone game onto it instead ? just take the old java version and change it so itll be able to run on windows <num> , because this is not worth it .
__label__helpful most inconsistent gun fights ive ever seen in a game ! sometimes shotguns do <num> damage a shot and sometimes they do literally less than <num> . tactical shotguns do an average of <num> dmg . wtf ? rifles can take <num> + shots to kill ? subs take <num> shots ? rockets do less damage than a pump shotty headshot . the cosmetics are awesome but i cant have fun playing a game with the worst gunfights than any game ive ever seen . they focus on adding stuff to their game rather than balancing the game they already have . for a third person shooter , this game is embarrassingly bad . make shotguns do hard damage . not variety . ars are painfully inaccurate . i could rant about the cons of this game for hours whereas i can finish listing the pros in <num> minutes . epic games , i think i speak on behalf of your most disgruntled fans , balance your gun fights . this is just infuriating to watch and play . <num> . almost unplayable .
__label__helpful the more you add to the game , the worse it gets . shotguns are utter trash now and the game gets buggier
__label__helpful just read some reviews . its a fun game but is ruined by constant crashes or random deaths , inconsistent lootbuilding texture loading so you die or get stuck . random controller bugs , random fps drops in the end game . cars and bikes flip because of a tiny bump and kill you , hit a pebble and lose massive health , or maybe explode randomly . being shot behind cover or shooting through targets . its fun and exciting but has way , way too many issues to be released .
__label__helpful however , you must have <num> other people for this game to shine . it is very uncommon that you will find someone that is playing this game alone , for the scenario that you only have <num> friends to play with . or when you have <num> friends to play with , you must disappoint one of them with the news that they cannot play with you . it is a shame that they only have <num> player modes and for that reason , i knocked off a star . otherwise , the content is great , and i hope more games like this come out in the future and they keep working on this game .
__label__unhelpful this game is pure honestly the servers never work and when your about to get a win you get some massive lag which is annoying because then you loose or die so honestly screw this retarded game
__label__helpful pistons , command blocks , pc commands like gamemode or spawnpoint , the ability to sign into your minecraft account , and compatibility with pc and xbox servers . that is all this game needs , make it happen mojang . other than that , good game . sincerely , cnugent <num> (mrthrall) .
__label__unhelpful this game is not very good . it is rng , its mostly wandering , not very original , and is boring . oh yeah never has a sharp metal object been so pitiful . the games positives are occasionally being fun , it is satisfying to win , and you have nothing to lose cause its free . oh yeah i lag less in call of duty wwii
__label__unhelpful i paid $ <num> and cant even play .
__label__helpful probably the most tactical first person shooter ive ever played . the game is deep and rewarding to play . players who have a plan will always beat those who just run and gun so teamwork is vital . the game is super addicting , the first <num> hours or so , but , i hate how much renown is needed for cosmetics and later operators in the game . i recommend this game but expect some grinding to get the really cool operators .
__label__helpful not the full p . c . experience but a pretty good game . very simple to use and mod like p . c . and also works with pocket edition multiplayer with the easy and intuitive p . c . controls .
__label__helpful everything has been cleared up . my kids and i play together on this game and have lots of fun .
__label__unhelpful if you like call of duty , you would like this game . furthermore , you cannot leave spawn without getting killed , on attack , most defenders just roam , so if you like getting spawned killed , get this game .
__label__unhelpful <emoji> supposed to be <num> star
__label__unhelpful the shotgun needs to be capped at <num> damage while point blank . its mid rang damage needs to be reduced ! it makes no sense how a blue pump can do <num> damage from mid range !
__label__unhelpful save the world is good but the battle royale is a waste of money and time
__label__helpful player base is too toxic to have fun without <num> other friends in your squad
__label__unhelpful i really like it , they have improved since the last version . keep the updates coming mojangmicrosoft .
__label__helpful this game is amazing judging by its great interior , and its only in beta ! you can play multiplayer with this amazing software and it is easily able to be entertaining game . i am a proud customer to purchase this item .
__label__unhelpful everyone is like talking a lot about this game everywhere and i cant wait to actually put my hands on such game . and best of all , its free to play !
__label__unhelpful the game is trash . it still has a ton of crash issues even after server updates that were supposed to fix the issues . audio needs tuning as well . sounds will emitt from the wrong audio speaker causing confusion . a lot of intermittent lag , rubberbanding , map and weapons not rendering . save your money until their updates do what they claim .
__label__helpful it has potential is an understatement . for being on as powerful as a system as xbox , and giving all of us the hassles along with its <num> $ pricetag , that over a million people bought into , and bluehole has us as the testers for free . . reviewing and reporting . without a reward , wait . no . they give ingame points to a broken customization system to which the player uses <num> , <num> , <num> , ect . in points to receive an item thats valued at <num> , <num> , <num> , with that , the player often gets rewarded the same item multiple times . theres really no reason for most of this games flaws , it just shows bad management , and i say that with confidence looking at my junky phone that can run games very similar to this , with none of the problems . people are not going to concern themselves with the games full release , because of all the flaws and frustrations bluehole has chose to put us all thru , chose , because , they released an unfinished game with a pricetag . well , unfinished for xbox <num> .
__label__helpful the tutorial is long , begining map sector is too easy to the point where you dont even need to build defences . if you make it past the first few hours i think its fun but could get old pretty fast . recommend playing with friends , blast through the beginning , and it gets more challenging . btw this game will be free next year if you dont want to risk buying it .
__label__helpful fantastic game . looks much better than the original pc edition . there are a few glitches that need working on though . for one , double chests can be placed right next to each other , no trap chests needed (not that im complaining about that . ) another is chests do not open when there is a slab or stair block right above them . with trees , vines seem to stay suspended in mid air even right after i destroy the entire tree . and (minor bug) if i use the scroll wheel on my mouse to switch between items , every time i mine a block , it switches from my diamond pickaxe to whatever slot it was on before i switched back to the diamond pickaxe . its really weird , however , knowing you mojang , you will fix this issue . i still rate <num> though . : d
__label__unhelpful i wanna love this game . its so much fun . but epic wtf . this is such a poorly developed game it gives me the runs . srsly stop adding and fix this game plz for the love of gods . honestly <num> star game from a <num> star company . oh btw the game should run better after a maintenance . and yet every time they fix something the game runs worse . trash trash trash . epic games can eat a . well you get it .
__label__unhelpful a <num> game too add to you collection !
__label__helpful its a amazing game ! but fix the severs because i cant get in my game to see season <num> <emoji> .
__label__helpful <num> k gamerscore , actually bought it , dont have xbox x just normal . got <num> th in my very first match , <num> kills . sick . google the controls , play the game , these bad ratings are from people experiencing early bugs . graphics are real enough for me . please give credit where credit is due . fla as helpful this was a lot of typing .
__label__helpful free till noveber <num> wether you like this game or not free is free
__label__unhelpful fortnite is what you get if you combined pubg world style and combat , with minecrafts fun building , and overwatchs skins . except fortnite manages to make it all suck . i know its my opinion , but i dont believe this game deserves all the praise it got and is still getting .
__label__helpful although this game is fun . it lacks content . no campaign for the great trailer . terrible bots leaving you to only play online for fun . always playing attack and defend . the game can get very repetitive . very low amount of map to play with . but the game is also very structured intelligent and tactical . every approach should be calculated . and you need to keep your awareness high . make sure you choose the right operator and ability to help you on your mission .
__label__helpful can we get some more animals ? i love the new aquatic update but more animals would be nice . also some more food variations ! so far i have loved minecraft for years !
__label__unhelpful the game is stupid because : <num> st microsoft made it and they wont just money money money . you need to buy skins ! lol <num> nd mincrosoft is gonna have theyre own servers that means no one is gonna play the servers hosted by players that means no fun . that is sad because i love to be a owner of a server but now in this game there are gonna be no players and microsoft if you are reading this please dont think always about money you have <num> bilions and please dont destroy the game with that thing let the players host thair own servers = more fun if you will have your own servers no one is gonna play server from the players . if you would fix that the game is gonna be awesome please lett the players have the servers and microsoft the game : )
__label__helpful for everyone complaining its buggy or laggy , no crap , its in preview . you should have known this before buying as it is plastered everywhere , so dont complain about things that can be fixed over time as the game updates . theyve already released one update <num> week after release that has improved the stability and some bugs . i do have to agree with vehicles being annoying at the moment but i think that will die down as people get better at playing without aim assist and as they learn how to shoot in this game , because it can be difficult at first . in conclusion i couldnt recommend the game more if you know going in its in preview and to expect some lag , bugs and glitches that will be fixed over time . will update my review as time goes on .
__label__helpful servers are rough right now . game plays sub <num> fps which makes it difficult .
__label__unhelpful ahhhhhh . why . straight copy of ddlc ! ginger gunner is sayori like y ? also in titled towers u can actully see sayori dead ! yuri always gets her fire ball jutsu and kills u ! she then fricken eats your wepons ! in moisty mire monika always gets her keyblade and beats u toooooo death ! natsuki is always watching fullmetal alchy ! and says manga is love manga is life ! nuuuuuuu ! monika has magic penis power and kills ! im done they ruined ddlc ! <emoji> <emoji>
__label__helpful awesome ! i love the crossplay compatability with : xbox one , nintendo switch , and mobile !
__label__unhelpful if you want smooth gameplay , look elsewhere . textures do not load after dropping off , keyboard and mouse users ruin precisionbased gameplay , heavily rng based early on (you get a gun or you dont) . and the devs have absolutely no intention of fixing any of this . if fortnite ever adds a game type that doesnt allow building then i will happily substitute it due to the fact that it is significantly more optimised . if you plan on getting pubg , get it on pc . the xbox version is grossly unfinished to the point where it should be near criminal to charge money to gain access to this nonsense . and if all of this wasnt enough , the devs believe this heaping trash heap to be esports ready . <emoji> edit : other br games that dont include building are about to make this game an untextured disgusting piece of shameful history . good riddance .
__label__helpful this game causes extreme stress and anxiety . the game is heavily luck based and is not welcoming to new players . the developers just make the game worse instead of bettr and on top of that they do not listen to the community and listen to the child fanbase . the game causes a lot of anger and is anything but fun . i do not recommend this game to anyone because i dont want them to get the same effects it caused me (anger , stress , and anxiety)so please do not play this game it is only welcome to very high skilled players and the devs dont listen once so ever . so please spare yourself from the horror that is fortnite .
__label__helpful its a great game fun to play helpful when bored the only thing i dont like is it freezes up every now and then but besides that great ! : )
__label__helpful if we can just have less popping in for the rendering of buildings and characters and more dissolved in style of rendering that is less of an eyesore . controls seem to be broken for map <num> . vehicles dont drive in map <num> . the ads is broken in map <num> , the sensitivity drops and have to enter settings in order to fix it . collision detection in muddy un rendered buildings is and has been frustrating and nearly unacceptible .
__label__helpful i honestly expected something more like the xbox one version of mc considering this will be cross plat . i was very wrong . its the pocket version . there is nothing else to it . i cannot recommend this because as i have always thought , the pocket edition shouldnt even be consuming developer time . they should be putting this effort into the actual versions of the game . this version is basically a playable trailer of the real thing , so to speak . you get the minecraft mechanics and thats about it . i cannot see myself recommending this game , in fact i can see my self doing the opposite . telling people to not bother wasting their time . my copy of mc cost <num> bucks . ive been playing since <num> . this might appeal to the kids and casual players , but for a player like me , waste of time .
__label__unhelpful make minecraft cheaper because what if people dont have that type of money you guys are messed up !
__label__helpful the best part of the game is the building aspect . if this game didnt have building , it would be like any other survival game . keep up the astonishing work . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful this game was designed for brads and chads .
__label__unhelpful so what is the excuse gonna be now that it isnt in preview ? same horrible gameplay but now you can buy useless cosmetics ! this company is a joke and hasnt given a thought about their customers .
__label__helpful i love this version of minecraft , and for all of the people who want other things , be patient . they are still adding things bit by bit . i am confident that this version and the pocket edition will be the best versions of the game .
__label__helpful let us play against ps <num> people
__label__helpful this game works great on my laptop and desktop , and if it doesnt just change a few settings ! the cross platform multiplayer is always a great feature to have although not many games implement them . touch , keyboard , and controller support exist allowing for whatever is most comfortable for the player ! the only problem is the fact that it doesnt support splitscreen coop like the xbox version does , and with already including controller support , i feel kind of cheated .
__label__unhelpful battle royale is just another lame pvp that only , and i mean only , rewards couch potatoes . if youre lucky enough to have some intelligent squad mates , you can still get jumped by someone who can snipe you with a shotgun from several blocks away (not kidding) . the pve story mode is ok , progression is slow but fun . the crafting and leveling systems are likely to drive anyone up a wall , theyre so unnecessarily complicated (doubt theyll ever fix that either but oh well) . if you have the patience , pve is worth the money . battle royale is not (and its free)
__label__helpful i have been a fan of minecraft since i was nine and i played the first release sometime around april or may maybe a little later . i love everything they have done to the game and are doing with the game itself ! it is amazing . keep it up ! i only think that the pc windows <num> edition should be compatible with the xbox one , for a number of reasons . one : being that you have to connect to xbox live . two : being that so many other games are going cross platform and it really works with games such as rocket league . if you read this , thank you for taking your time to appreciate a long time lovers review . the game is really worth <num> stars if you can have fun and play with friends . trust me ! worth the buy !
__label__helpful the game is fun and thrilling <emoji> plus its free !
__label__unhelpful so much fun , solo or with friend , <emoji>
__label__unhelpful alway makes me wait an hour to <num> mins an rips me off when i bought the sarter pack only gave me <num> v bucks not <num> v bucks and always kicks me out of game
__label__helpful this is just terrible . it is based off pocket edition , but not as good as pocket edition . currently , this is basically worthless . a few major annoyances : the mouse sensitivity is through the roof , making the game unplayable . changing your name costs money . you are forced to log into an xbox live account , and forced to pay money if you want to change your name . no real fullscreen . it looks like they want to sell you skins through this app . feature list is the same as pocket edition , but not complete . right now avoid this like the plague . some part of me knew microsoft would screw this up . i was naïve and hopeful , though , which just leaves me more upset . also good luck dealing with microsoft account recovery if you havent yet . updating this review just to say that all these problems still exist . this version of minecraft is still terrible .
__label__unhelpful ovo je najbolja igrica na svijetu !
__label__helpful this game is awsome . way more strategic than any other <num> st person shooters . great way to bond with a team . it is best expierianced with a team of people with mics . super challenging , which is what you want in games . no game ive played lately has top this game . filled with instant fun .
__label__helpful i sold my wife and daughter for wifi and vbucks , best game ever . ps gave every one thats come to my house ligma also if you think you can clap my cheeks you better sleep with one eye open
__label__helpful grab your squad , grab some friends and set back and play some rainbow ! this game is fit for you if you love using your mind (unlike my ex) . you should have a great time my dudes ! definately try it !
__label__helpful when i loaded up the game it was kinda exiting . its linked to your microsoft account , which is a cool feature meaning i could possibly play with my friends platforms and have the game linked to my xbox account along with built in controller compatibility . however upon delving into the options menu , and playing a few minutes of it , i can tell you its not ready for pc . first of all , there is very little to graphics customization . second , i can only assume the game runs smoothly because the frames are locked at (what i can only guess at because there is no way to access a counter) substantially below <num> frames with no option to turn it up . third is the fact that pc players are not going to play something in which they have to pay for texture packs or skins when they can just as easily do so for free in the other version . if any developers are reading this review , i implore you to at least put in the minimum amount of graphical tweaking that and <num> fps that is standard on pc .
__label__unhelpful fantastic game yet full of glitches . every update brings more and more glitches . fix the glitches already ! im tired of wiping my progress and starting over to get rid of the glitches . if you cant take care of game problems then you shouldnt be charging for it . note : glitches keep persisting now for over a year . have not been fixed .
__label__helpful so far so good , not a real competitor to the java version yet , no mod support , etc . hope those features come in the future ! (people kinda predicted a windows only version lol) . i seem to be getting some slight input lag , <num> ms , just noticeable . i have high hopes for this , considering microsoft has resources that mojang could only dream of . dont f it up . im talking to you . microsoft . (that means no micro transactions)
__label__helpful may have something if updates help
__label__helpful a few hours is enough to realise that without friends to play together with or a system to prevent early quitters from wasting players time and the occasional scumbag ending games instantly with a team kill or someone purposely failing a mission immediately as it begins makes this game unplayable solo and a very tough purchase at <num> $ . in short wait until the price drops ( <num> $) , look for a sale or wait until it becomes free to play so that your not left with a feeling of buyers remorse . also note that this game somehow managed to make me bother with writing my first review out of pure frustation . only fun is with friends or a good team .
__label__helpful i love the survival end of the game . start from nothing , make tools , shelter , food supply , go on adventures and find treasures guarded by hordes of enemies deep in caves . soon you will be able too make about anything you can think up . i cant wait for the friendly update . great job . my only complaint is . ummm . i started with a commador <num> a long time ago and cant believe the sad little kids who have no clue how far games have come are allowed too post bad reviews about a game that allows you too create a virtual world that can be anything you want it too be . and now even in vr . a <num> year old can now do this if he wanted too . from pong and such too this . awesome ! update on the latest update ! the new texture packs are worth every penny . now minecraft has grown up ! looks more realistic with the city textures . mobs even have cool new outfits . i play mostley on my pc with no known issues , the only dif . i see from my pocket edition is no crafting help in menu .
__label__helpful ima keep this short and sweet . in your face shooter . team work is key . there r no respawning in game untill each round . cons teamkilling happend to many kids need more adults . other then that great shooter
__label__helpful man i love player unknowns battle gr i mean , fortnite !
__label__helpful game wont even open anymore ,
__label__helpful game was just tranfered to xbox . it wont be perfect day one . if u enjoyed pc version , controller is nice just need <num> get used <num> it . other that i love it . graphics are great when they render but like i said give it time . its xbox not pc . you wont get perfect everything
__label__helpful this is a paid closed beta but nowhere in the description does it mention this . dont waste your money .
__label__helpful if you really think about it there is a whole lot of other games out there that deserves recognition and should have a massive multiplayer community . but this is what really i see everywhere ? i know thats because its a trend . everybody i know irl or through xbox grinds this including me but in reality its not even that fun . i just wish this game will die sooner than later . (please) +i have been playing this non stop since season <num> stealing ws but dont get a free skin just emotes and a free lolipop axe so far smh
__label__helpful so the thing that ruins the game the most is the fact you dont gain anything for winning or getting a kill , mostly vbucks . not only that , the save the world game mode was said to be free by <num> , but we are half way into <num> and it still costs money . basically false advertising right there .
__label__unhelpful pubg killed this game , so it dumped this unplayable clone for free avoid . wait for the real thing
__label__helpful minecraft has always been a game for the balls of eyes to enjoy . definitely worth every penny
__label__unhelpful worst purchase ive made on xbox and i bought <num> days to die and ark on release . this is garbage compared to fortnite .
__label__unhelpful i cart beleeve the makor of this gaym hav te bawls <num> copi forknight completely unnoriginnul <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the game is good but could you give free vbucks because i dont have any pls my name is washingb i on xbox pls send my vbucks like <num> vbucks pls
__label__helpful i love the touch screen controls . i have a tablet pc with windows <num> and i can play regular minecraft on it , but it is slow and i need to use a blue tooth keyboard and mouse with it . i have the regular version on my laptop , but i wanted a smaller , touch screen compatible version for my smaller tablet and this is perfect . this version has a great touch control set up and it is really easy to control . the sound doesnt always work on it though and i have to stop it and reload it to make it work . once that is fixed i will give it <num> stars . (updated to <num> stars now that sound seems to be fixed) also , it would be nice if it had all of the objects from the original version . its only missing a few that i have noticed so far so it is not a game killer for me , but i miss those items .
__label__helpful it was fun but now the screen wont fit
__label__helpful this game is the best ! you should get it ! great for passing time . but i would say it is better with other players on the worlds . but still fun !
__label__helpful at first this game was great , now its just team killing and trolls . i officially regret buying the digital copy of this game . way to fail ubisoft .
__label__unhelpful no matter how much you like this game , you cant ignore the handfull of problems it has , but the worse of them all is the bad frame drops , rendering , and resolution . these <num> problem give me a splitting headache (especially when driving) and just kills the joy for me . fortnight is free and yet it has way more features and smoother game play ; pubg is <num> $ and has notting (no special gamemodes , daily missions , reachable cosmetics . ) shouldnt it be the other way around ? this may be a game preview but being the only new exclusive xbox has , you would think this game would be better but nope they rather push it out of their to milk the hell out of the holiday season . my first review was much more lenient but they still deleted it . deleting truthful reviews is very shady microsoft , your going to lose more and more people
__label__helpful even though this is a game preview , the amount of times this game crashes is unacceptable . if you cant handle the amount of people in a game , wait to release it until you can . if you want to play a battle royale game that doesnt crash , play fortnite , even mobile device battle royales dont have this many issues , i . e . rules of survival . this game has so much potential as long as it can fix its severe connection flaws .
__label__unhelpful this is what i would expect from a port of a game issued on a very limited platform such as a smart phone or a last gen console . it stays true to the blocky graphics however does not take advantage of the higher resolutions a pc enjoys with even a basic built in gpu on the mobo . i can not see playing this version over the java pc version even if worlds are portable between xb <num> , pc , and phone . lots of work to do
__label__unhelpful its addicting , i play it on the <num> , cant play it on my laptop due to graphics issues . but now i can thanks to this edition . i would love to see repeaters added to the list of the red stone . more like strongly suggest it . all do to the fact that i cant do some things that i can do on the <num> edition . love the fact that i am now officially able to play with my friend on the x <num> from my pc , its a great feature when i am not able to play on my x <num> .
__label__unhelpful runs like crap . an unacceptable release of a game . controls are horrid , terrible graphics . <num> frames per second at best
__label__unhelpful its a great game and all and i dont extremely dislike it , but i feel it is too closely related to pe . coming from the regular pc version , this is extremely different , and there are too many to name . second of all , i would prefer to have the ability to go on servers (i . e mineplex) . playing on singleplayer mode only gets very boring after a while .
__label__helpful the only thing i hate is the dmg system . either make it more realistic or keep the dmg equal for the gun you use . very annoying where you shoot someone with a close shotgun <num> times and they dont die while they shoot you once with rifle and you die .
__label__helpful i play this a lot with my brother . its fun to play on the same world as your friends . all you have to do is be on the same wifi ! minecraft is a great game and is fun for all ages .
__label__unhelpful i dont even do reviews but they just obliterated pubg . its free , now plays in <num> fps , consistent updates and has a pve mode within the full game purchase . im gladly giving this game <num> stars for how far they have come in a such short amount of time . they fix bugs asap and actually deliver their product in a timely fashion . my god , i must say i am proud of you fortnite ! please keep up the good work . these triple aaa companies need to learn from the little guys and actually deliver quality like this in reasonable quantities . well done ! slow claps <emoji> download this and try it out . you wont be disappointed with the latest update . <num> <emoji>
__label__helpful this game does not disappoint . it is so relaxing and just a great game to play . this version of it is nearly , if not completely , caught up to the standard version . for the current price of $ <num> . <num> , it is a steal !
__label__helpful it lacks many of the features of the pc version , but im sure those will be along soon enough . the biggest plus is the speed : i have it set on highest quality graphics with the greatest render distance and it still runs smoothly . the biggest downside is the lack of configuration options . i really miss the ability to configure the key layout . i like the graphics . they update the look while keeping the iconic feel . there are also some nice additions to the environment , like fallen logs in the forest , giant mushrooms in the swamp and spawning baby animals of all species . as soon as they port a few more features from the pc version ill probably start playing this version exclusively .
__label__unhelpful the game is beautifully designed and programmed , just like the other minecraft versions ive played . all its missing is that glorious map , xd but other than that it is an awesome game and very addicting
__label__helpful dont play much of minecraft but still enjoyed playing this . i dont know if it beats the legit $ <num> dollar version but still great . and cross play is beautiful . way to go microsoft !
__label__helpful the sound is glitch but still a good game . needs more computer version . and keep up the good work mojang
__label__helpful i love this game , but the full release has come with some major bugs . ill be standing there shooting into a guy (with blood coming off him) , and hell just turn around , fire a couple rounds , and im dead . another issue is being shot through walls (i have video) . my internet is very good where i am and have not had any problems with other games . recently have been killed by people who havent rendered in . has seen no improvements since full launch .
__label__unhelpful i like it . its basically a port of the mobile version of minecraft . except it only runs on x <num> cpus , which is annoying . my hp stream has a x <num> cpu but is running <num> bit windows due to the ram so i cannot install this game on it . update : now that it works on x <num> devices , it works flawlessly .
__label__unhelpful i would say its a nice game for kids since its free , but it promotes unrealistic violence ! if you play this , please do us both a favor and block me because our mental state and capacity arent on the same level . chop some rocks to build yourself a fort , let it be your tomb✌
__label__helpful dont buy and support ubisofts bow to chinese censorship .
__label__helpful this game is amazingly fun , the graphics bug out at the start of the game a little bit , you barely notice the fps unless you played on pc first , and finally its a kick a game even in early access . do yourself a favor and buy it . <emoji> ✌
__label__helpful not for the casual player who just wants to play a game after a long day of work . if youre a try hard with too much free time , then this is the game for you . pubg has an overall better rating and its broken and cost $ <num> . that should tell you all you need to know about fortnite .
__label__helpful so , one of the problems i have is that it should be cheaper if it was like $ <num> . <num> you would make more because people wouldnt be spending so much so they wouldnt mind buying it . i will give you guys a <num> star rating if you can lower the price of the game . thank you for reading my comment and see yall
__label__unhelpful i have purchased this game already , yet everytime i open it i must click buy minecraft and access the internet . i am given an error user already owns message and then i am given access . this requires me to have access to the internet to play the game , which , as a truck drive , i do not always have available to me . help me fix this and its an easy <num> star
__label__unhelpful i have all the operators and unlocked , but now some reason i dont have him and i said oh thats not a big deal . ill just buy him back . so im going to go buy him back right and guess what theyre more expensive so i cant buy him back . and the other guy and that guy , but i cant get them either why the hell you taking my operator
__label__helpful good game but getting team killed for no reason is bs feel like i cant enjoy the game when i play with a random that team kills me for no reason
__label__unhelpful its ok <emoji> , i mean , i won <num> times on this game yeah so i like this game
__label__unhelpful operation health is nearly finished , and its developers have yet to relieve their game of its major issues . such as : serverconnectivity problems (random disconnections) , ingame mechanics (hit boxes and balancing) , and more . for a game that has been out for <num> years , and one that has a blooming community , it funnels out into just an addition to ubisofts recent collection of generic , let downofagame .
__label__helpful this a more basic version of minecraft pc , and this game feels very similar to minecraft pocket edition . i know this game is still in beta but mojang (microsoft) please make it less of pocket edition and base it around pc , otherwise this game is great . its defiantly faster than regular minecraft pc which i like .
__label__helpful i been reading all these reviews from cry babys bc the game has issues . it just dropped in the preview program . its gonna get better with time hence the reason its in the preview program . for those that dont know the preview program gives you early access to games in development . it isnt a finished game yet . the game is fun and will only get better from here on out .
__label__unhelpful this game was running fine until just recently on the pve side , literally just lost all my inventory and ability to build stuff , the game lags every <num> seconds , every new daylag , new player joins lag , swarm of zombies lag , giving players xp boostlag , this game is a grinder it used to be fun for me but now its just unplayable
__label__helpful i played three games and thanks to lag(not on my end) i lost them all i was top ten in all of them but no your game lagged and every time wall killed me not a player . one time i was so close my person was standing in the line and then lag and he stood there and rubber banded till the wall killed me
__label__helpful today , pubg is at the top of the charts in terms of brstyle games , and for good reason . but i feel on xbox it has been given more praise than deserved . i understand that the game is in early access , but its been advertised so much , and in such a way , as if its a full release . i mean , we even have a pubg xbox one bundle now . a bundle including a game that is incomplete and riddled with bugs and performance issues . the average consumer is unaware the game is in as incomplete a state as it is , which is why the game receives about as many complaints as it does compliments . as often stated , pubg suffers from pretty poor optimization , causing inconsistent framerate (often dropping very low) , lag and rubberbanding , and general graphical bugs . couple this with buggy physics and a strange control scheme , often made worse by the other problems and recurring input lag . all these issues aside , i still play and enjoy the game . i would however highly recommend the pc version over this any day .
__label__helpful fix ur game u
__label__helpful building mechanic is awesome ! simple , flexible and fun . you can use it to build forts before the wave comes , or like a defensive weapon in the heat of combat . the part of the game not in the videos is a deep mathcard collection game like a rpg , with <num> unique character models so far , firstperson perspective option (wo weapon animation) , and large level areas with very welldone procedural generation . downside ? needs a toggle for firstperson . this game is an awesome , snazzy zombie survival version of star trek onlines mathcard game .
__label__unhelpful every time i fire up the game theres is this dark grey window that pops in and out constantly causing the game to be unplayable . im unable to move even past the very first screen . bought this application to play with my kids , but im not even able to utilize it . edit : working on fixing the issue . ill keep you posted .
__label__helpful its a mind blowing game mojang its cool
__label__helpful game gets worst with every update still . its like they dont care . let microsoft step in and fix this game already . how can they release a second map when they cant even get the first one right ? nothing but in game issues .
__label__helpful this is a great idea to allow crossplatform gaming ! i love it !
__label__unhelpful i made the mistake of purchasing this thinking it would be similar to the actual full original game . instead it ended up simply being a lackluster port of the mobile version . there needs to be more clarity that the actual pc version and this empty shell are two completely separate and different versions of each other .
__label__unhelpful i cant update ! and if i cant update i cant pay with my friends ! what the mojang ?
__label__helpful i love how it is similar to pocket edition , and older versions of the computer version !
__label__helpful i love how you can seamlessly switch from controller to keyboard . it feels like i can switch at the drop of a hat . i love all of the block options that are available all in one place . i love how it looks and runs on my pc , and that all of the custom options are there for when you want to customize your game . it seems like this will be a fantastic version of the game when it gets fully released . however , a huge complaint i have is that you cant customize controls yet . im a left handed person who cant use my right hand very well except for easy tasks , so generally i like to move my character with the arrow keys using my right hand and do everything else with my left . also there are a few things that make it hard to use the controller as well , but that may just be me not used to a new layout yet . so for now the game is a bit awkward and challenging to play physically . ill keep trudging on because i absolutely love minecraft , but please work on this feature soon so i can play fully .
__label__unhelpful i cant get in on pc
__label__helpful i cannot install on my dell venue <num> pro running the latest build of windows <num> . the install button is greyed out and there is a message stating to use this app , youll need a device with more features . for details , see additional info . there is no relevant information in the additional info section . how do i get this game installed ? there doesnt appear to be a clear path for support via the store and microsoft help pages .
__label__helpful 
__label__helpful so we dont , earnv coins and . it glith alot dont wast your time download . it
__label__helpful fortnite takes a lot of popular mechanics and makes a game out of them . zombies ? check . horde mode ? check . lots of loot ? check . crafting and base building ? check . tower defense ? check . rpg style skills trees ? double check . its not short lf its flaws , however . game crashes more often than i would like , i can see the missions getting repetative , and there is a slight lean towards pay to win . but if you enjoy grinding for loot and buildingdefending bases , than this is the game for you .
__label__helpful it is surely a game that will keep you interested throughout the time you play . always keeping you on your toes with thoughts of where you will get shot at from next . it is definitely a game that is worth a shot ! <num> !
__label__helpful i enjoy game with the little amount of friends i have .
__label__helpful this game is very competitive . i stay away from casual . because no one takes it serious and they tk . ranked will raise your game and be enjoyable if you love competition and have patience n the desire to be great . but somtimes you get the occasional random who kills your vibe i would say for better enjoyment play with <num> buddys at the minimum . but me n my pal do fine with us <num> n randoms as we were gold <num> last season . n oh yeah beware of the dreaded glaz
__label__helpful the lack of mods is disappointing but overall its well done and runs well on modest hardware . five stars if it ever gets mod support .
__label__unhelpful every time i open this game , i check the settings , and immediately close it and head back to the real minecraft . this game would be worth playing for so many people , including myself , if you didnt keep trying to force the controller on us . its not hard to code button mapping . you already do it with controller , just do it with keyboard and mouse . minecraft is simply much better with keyboard and mouse , simple as that . ive been playing for a very long time , and i own every version of minecraft available . ive done the testing .
__label__helpful pubg is obviously in its game preview stage , and should be treated that way . this game has been getting better each day . pubg has already come out with <num> patches . dont listen to the people that do not understand that this game is practically in beta . pubg is great and will get even better .
__label__unhelpful nothing to like about it . frame rate should be <num> fps but its only <num> fps but gameplay is literally maybe <num> fps . game gets even worse fps and lag when shooting someone . going back to fortnite much much better than this . i will be refunding this game asafp
__label__helpful im so tired of this game <num> percent is luck base you took it from pubg it lags and gliches i like the style but fix it please .
__label__unhelpful the game seems to run on cpu only , completely ignoring the gpu . it saturates <num> threads on brand new intel chip , yet the performance is awful at <num> .
__label__helpful ive been watching this game for a long time and am extremely happy that its finally out . though there are still problems , like the crashes , low framerate , and occasional freezing , but i completely understand that its because its being ported from pc , so its not going to be flawless . cant wait for it to be finished !
__label__helpful this is in prerelease . if youre a fan of battle royales , check it out . it has its bugs but pure game play wise , it is fun . this is definitely not a must buy right now but once its time for full release , this game will be even more enjoyable .
__label__helpful this game needs a great amount of patience for new players . hardcore game meta .
__label__helpful can i download it for phones ? please help
__label__unhelpful this game is for kids . freeplay has little rewards . building ruins combat . get pubg for real strategic combat
__label__unhelpful pubg is the single , greatest game in the world . from the smooth controls and above average graphics , this game is a great buy for any hardcore gamer . sure theres a few bugs , but hey , thats expected in any game . even its top competitor , fortnite , has bugs , so cut it some slack . all in all , buy this game , and drop in solo , or i recommend with your friends .
__label__helpful great game but is ruined by the community that constantly team kills for the slightest thing .
__label__unhelpful dont be suprised when nothing loads in and you run at <num> fps max
__label__helpful i think buying this version of mc was a great deal for $ <num> . <num> . it runs so smooth , even if your computer isnt top notch . i recommend this game <num> .
__label__helpful it is really good but the only problem is i think resource packs should be free like on pc but a question i have is are we gonna be able to go on servers soon or in a later update ?
__label__unhelpful epic games does not know how to handle a game . everything is unbalanced and stuff that needs to be nerfed gets buffed and everything that needs to be buffed gets nerfed . and . this game is mostly on luck . not skill
__label__helpful its fine , but the lag ruins the whole game
__label__unhelpful garbage laggy as hell plus i got a <num> damage with a blue pump from point blank then got <num> shot by a green pump . please learn how guns work irl and fix your poopy gun logics <emoji>
__label__unhelpful wont install on my pc
__label__helpful the fact that people hype this game as much as they do means that the human race is doomed . the community is really freakin toxic . consider how bout half the world spend their lives on this game and put that together with their toxicity and you will understand this dire situation .
__label__helpful this game allows me to enjoy the creative side of my person , as no other game has ever done . ive built some of the most amazing things . i would like one thing , tho . i would like , when i need an update , to be able to simply click update . . thats all . thanks ! for an awesome , awesome game ! : )
__label__helpful unlike <num> of the reviews here , i am going to try to give an actual review . pvp is fun with friends , but can be frustrating at times (but what games arnt ? ) . there are some problems , like odd hit detection and a very steep learning curve . for a free to play game however (or partly free anyway) , this is incredibly good . i love the style of the game as well . most games in this genre all want to be realistic , but this one takes a chaotic cartoony approach that feels and plays very differently then the other games in the genre (for reference , i have played h <num> z <num> and pubg) . if you want a realistic experience , then this is not the game for you . otherwise , i would recommend trying it out at least . personally , i enjoy the alternate game modes best like <num> v <num> . i recommend playing with friends , as playing alone can be boring at times . oh , and did i mention cross play ? i often play this game on pc with friends on xbox or mobile . you cant play with psn players sadly .
__label__helpful this is gonna be an epic game when they polish this fun game but should let us map our own controller <emoji>
__label__helpful it made my pee pee hard
__label__unhelpful i enjoy playing the pocket edition version of this game . and having the feeling of bringing it to the pc makes it feel more fluid . note this does need a good gpu otherwise you wont feel it .
__label__unhelpful i am autistic but i still like this game
__label__helpful i like about this game is the variety of the worlds special forces spetsnaz , sas fbi swat gs <num> all greats units with own abilitys , but the game is turning into cs : go with skins and now lots of headgear and uniforms . they need to focus on hit registration , ashs hit box . server lag . and lagging out of games . focus on the game performance not how bright my uniform gets . please fix the game nobody in the r <num> community wants this to die as a franchise
__label__helpful this game is bs because of you all damn sweaty tryhards get good at the game you garbage players also fix pump dropoff im also an og player ( been playing since season <num> )
__label__helpful this is an updated review . the game is now out of preivew and i must say i am a bit impressed on the state of the game now . i havent had any crashes and frame rates at most on xbox one x have been ok . this game is a tactical shooter which is rare on console so my tactical shooter fans pick it up . i dont think i have to describe what battleroyale is im sure you have a good idea by now . pubg on xbox one is by far one of my favorite shooters along with rainbow six siege . this game has a way to kick you in the butt , its like the darksouls of shooters . the biggest problems are the broken patches and low frame rates , <num> fps should be standard , and <num> fps at the least . i dont know maybe you devs should build an all new game engine for <num> fps . just an idea
__label__helpful i like the cosmetics and understand why they cost money but what i dont understand is why people rage that you have to pay for them its not like it gives you any advantage that make people think that you might put up a good fight and people dont look at the fact yha their cool but epic needs some way of getting money to pay the people who contantly work on the game trying to make it better so player can play but you need to fix your shotguns epic
__label__unhelpful buyer beware dont buy this garbage . never ending money pit . <num> dollar event pass , microtransactions before stready frames an gameplay . thats what we all get after all this time and all our money . hiya guis thanks for you support these last months since preview we got somthing special for you in return for leaving yall hangin with a halfass game . you just got to spend some more money first . pubg devs . dont buy this garbage
__label__unhelpful i love this game so much its fun to play and everything but u need to upgrade it more we need more animals and u should have a server that everone can play on like a freee sever pls try to upgrade and make it a little bit more better thx x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num> x <num>
__label__unhelpful things id like to see . <num> . you can buy one item to spawn in with with points varying . <num> . have the gille available in the rewards crate . this isnt pc we cant trade clothes or buy from others . <num> . put cool clothes in the reward crate nobody wants a $ <num> dirty tank top like i just got . <num> . give vehicles traction . <num> . a zombie mode . <num> . if you have a med kit you can use it to pick yourself up if downed just make them a little more scarce . <num> . dont go nuts with buyable content . <num> . put out buyable content we want to buy help us help you that <num> dollar thing looks terrible . <num> . shoes that silent foot steps . <num> . a few up armored vehicles with a mounted gun random on the map . <num> . rpgs <num> . sniper bipods <num> . auto glock <num> . shoes that make you run faster <num> . taser <num> . claymore <num> . bear trap . <num> . grenade launcher <num> . a pack of wolves roaming instead of the bombs nobody dies from the bombs . <num> . spint while aim with fore grips . <num> . a message at the least if you think about using one of these ideas from this review .
__label__helpful i cant believe the amount of censorship going into this game stop its rated m for a reason
__label__unhelpful so this just a kids version of pubg but it is a good game
__label__helpful thank you trump for pubg usa usa usa
__label__helpful one of the most fun games ive ever played , wonderful community for example i needed some coal to finish a gun and its very hard for me to find and some guy just gave me some also i love the fact that you can pay the difference and upgrade to the more expensive versions without buying the game again
__label__helpful this is not a finished game , it is paid early access . it should be listed in the game preview program yet both microsoft and epic are more than willing to lie to you about what your buying . save your money for its free to play launch next year !
__label__helpful it on xbox finally . its over all good game besides low fps but its only on game preview . the game will get better as it develops . im also surprised how smoothly it run . great game . <emoji>
__label__unhelpful incredibly disappointed in the bofa in every match . save your time and just play skyrim .
__label__helpful fortnite sucks it is trash heck i agree it stinks hope this game dies it just suck
__label__helpful this game still has a long way to go since its a pc game . when bf <num> , and ark were released they were the worst but over time it got better . so for those of you who are questioning on whether or not to buy it just know itll only get better <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i was waiting for so long for operation white noise to come out for xbox then it did <num> day later the update is done its nothing but lag when its not my internet and the most unfair operator guns ! why ubisoft ! the new operators seriously need a nerf its not even fun to get shot in the chest by one of them and die instantly from it ! <emoji>
__label__helpful i love it so far just hope it gets fast updates for optimal performance ! it well get smoother in the coming weeks . i play on pc too and glad i can play with my xbox friends .
__label__helpful i love that this game can run great on low end pcs unlike the java version , and i love the cross platform play and controller support . but sometimes , exiting a world and re entering will cause all items on my character to just disappear , im glad i only had <num> stacks of wood for my house but im afraid this might happen with diamonds on me . also , when my items disappear , so do my sisters , (we play cross platform over lan , me on my pc and her on my nvidia shield portable . ) and we both lost all of our items . but when this glitch does not happen , it is a blast to play . also , it would be good for a different chest interface for controllerkeyboard and mouse , and the xbox crafting interface for controller only . i hope this glitch is fixed soon so we can play without worry .
__label__unhelpful game is garbage . guns are trash and shotguns are <num> inconsistent , and the game is <num> luck based . also players are rotten and bad sports .
__label__helpful this game copied pubg . and is starting to call every dance the fortnite dance
__label__unhelpful no gameplay variety at all !
__label__unhelpful im stoked ever since e <num> <num> showed gameplay
__label__helpful this game is great on its own already , but after they remade it for windows <num> , it is truly amazing . runs so smooth and im so happy for that !
__label__helpful i really like this game but censoring it <num> years after launch to appease chinas backwards rules is unacceptable . i recommend you do not buy unless ubisoft goes back on the plans to change the game to chinese standards .
__label__helpful the game constantly freezes and lags when in combat , and by the time your screen unfreezes , you have already been killed and looted . weapons are incredibly unbalanced and give players a huge unfair advantage (hand cannon , and basically any legendary) . absolute trash just man up and cough up the$ <num> for pubg on steam you lazy cheapskates . even the xbox one port is better than this mistake .
__label__unhelpful my first instinct in downloadinghearing about this version of minecraft was : oh look , this windows app is going to be a huge improvement , much faster than the previous java ones , and will probably be very similar . i couldnt have been more disappointed . i cannot believe that microsoft has actually completely taken over minecraft , adding the abominable inapp purchases , the appalling gamertags , and making all users sign into their microsoft accounts . windows has gobbled up companies in order to promote their products . i honestly cant believe mojang developers would allow this . mojang isnt even a word in microsoft dictionaries . and heres another complaint , the gui and behavior of the game makes me feel like im a <num> year old , trying to play an amalgam of the pocket edition and the xbox edition on a pc . i do not play this on a tablet ! the ratings on this game obviously are fake , or there is some incentive for rating it high . word limit is reached , thus always to tyrants !
__label__unhelpful its one of the best things ive ever played . its given me something to do on xbox since destiny <num> is dead . btw this is better than destiny <num> .
__label__helpful well , it runs faster than java minecraft because it was written in c++ . what i wish to be able to do is mod it in a . net language . i hope microsoft allows for that . features : directip connect to servers , lanservers , realms , limited vs unlimited world sizes downloading this was problematic : i think there is a bit of server overload for the windows store because i had to try many times to download it . serious downside : you will be required to register for xbox live and be logged into xbox live to play .
__label__helpful laggy and my game loads slowly . there is also desync throughout all my matches
__label__helpful this is a great start for minecraft in windows <num> ! i would give it <num> stars already , except for the lack of mashups , texture packs , skins and especially new worlds . if i could have rated it with <num> stars , i would if they would bring out more positive addons that also teach history or inspire imagination in a person . please keep up the great work and bring us , especially the multiplatform owners that want the addons and extras we enjoy on xbox , now on windows <num> .
__label__helpful currently , crashing and lack of controller layout settings makes the game a toss up . the idea is fun , but tears you down when you crash at a critical moment . do not buy until optimized . update : first person servers added are good . still doesnt matter if rubber banding kills you in top <num> .
__label__helpful its a very addicting game , love it ! however , there is one thing i wish for them to fix . when you connect to server it wont load . please fix this !
__label__helpful now i have played other royale game like the culling , and pubg , but none compare to fortnite . why ? well , you jump out of a flying vehicle and land somewhere on a well thought out , highly detailed island . you stock up on loot and start killing other unfortunate players who crossed paths with you . collect building materials so you can defend yourself , and others if you play duos and squads . with all this happening , a huge barrier , (the storm) closes in on all <num> players . if you win , you get a message saying <num> victory royale ! and the alltowellknown umbrella . repeat ! i mainly like fortnite because of the strategy used . when you die , you can learn your mistakes like i didnt build or i forgot crouching makes you accurate . really the only thing i dont like are fortnite trolls , but those are rare . that was my opinion . i hope it helped !
__label__unhelpful cant wait for this game it looks amazing
__label__unhelpful the cost is high but manage able but i dont understand why i unable to transfer to this computer from another because the other broke
__label__helpful this is honestly one of the worst modern era games ive played and that is taking into account that its a preview . graphics are mediocre , the map is extremely generic and uninspired and you will spend much of your time rubberbanding around it or just getting flat out dropped from matches . the controls , menus , map , and inventory are among the least intuitive and least user friendly ive ever seen . many issues like shots not registering or hitting feet away from your reticle even at close range , sounds like cars and gunfire cant be heard unless youre facing the direction it came from even when its right next to you , doors near you opening and closing instead of picking up the gear you are looking at , and other general coding issues . youll often feel like you completely wasted your time at the end of a match . for a game that was in beta on pc since march <num> , they should be embarrassed at the state of the game . with the exception of the concept , literally no positives at this time .
__label__unhelpful one of the best games out ! foget about pubg . fortnite willl change that trust
__label__unhelpful dont get me wrong i love this game but it freezes most of the time and i dont know why also whenever it freezes for me it takes awhile to unfreeze and i have a new laptop and thats not my problem .
__label__helpful this game is a little choppy but overall its very very fun and its only going to get better !
__label__helpful didnt give it <num> stars only because this game has currency called renown , the creators jack up the price to ridiculous amounts if you dont have season pass or the need to pay more money . i unlocked everything without paying extra . the characters are <num> renown wo pass which takes awhile but this game is so addicting once you learn , you can achieve it all . forget your actual job this is rainbow <num> seige . noobs always welcomed !
__label__unhelpful crossplatform between console and pc still isnt here and their is a lack of meaningful updates . stick to the java version , its far better .
__label__helpful me my dad little brother and big brother love minecraft its a safe nice game to play on rainy days . we play almost every day its sooooooooo much fun
__label__unhelpful its not worth a purchase , im not even sure if its worth the space on my hard drive ! i began playing minecraft in <num> and have loved the game . i have played the pc , xbox , and pocket edition versions and by far the best is pc it is the most developed , has the best community and the best interface ! first thing i noticed when opening up this game is an xbox live account is forced upon me . the next thing i noticed and probably the biggest downfall is the interface , they took the worst interface of the <num> and used it its awful . the pc community is one of the best communities i have ever seen and a large portion of that is due to mods and servers . and minecraft windows <num> edition does not support mods or servers yet ! the flying is god awful and it still fills your hot bar with items in creative a feature they removed ages ago on pc . dont buy this you will regret it .
__label__unhelpful rainbow six vegas <num> is a great game so why was everything that made it so good was taken out or replaced . online the r <num> s is decent , but reminds me of call of duty , offline terrorist hunt has no ai team or co op same console multiplayer , no storymode . this is disappointing
__label__helpful game is good . it has some glitches from time to time . ibought it at first release and has improved tremendously since initial release . buy now while its $ <num> and not <num> after full release . patience in killing in this game or else give away your position . remember its a preview and dont listen to all the negativity .
__label__unhelpful you can see the improvements , keep it up !
__label__helpful its an awesome game and has tons of stuff in it . i just wish it stopped freezing every single time i play ! its so frustrating ! could you plz try to fix that ? and update it to <num> . <num> . that would make my day , thanks ! ; )
__label__helpful at least when im writing this it was , $ <num> . <num> , great price . i could of sworn it was on steam a long time ago . must have changed when microsoft bought it , but nothing has changed about the game . still addictive and fun !
__label__unhelpful it runs fine on my machine but you loose that amazing feature of moving your worlds that you spend a lot of time building on from older versions . purchased for one machine to test , not likely to buy it for my kids . they dont want it on their machines because of that .
__label__unhelpful i may not be the number one player or created anything super cool , but ive put over <num> hours into this game tinkering and playing around . i have this on pc , xbox <num> , and xbox one , and every time i play its just as fun . either by starting out a new game and exploring the beginning again , or your massive save file where you have your fortress . either way , its tons of fun !
__label__helpful there is so much that needs fixing . awful framerate fluctuates between <num> and <num> fps , constant crashing , and massive ping spikes . it is still a game preview , sure , but in its current state it is borderline unplayable . after the first of what they call a performance update , the game actually got worse . it crashes on my xbox at least <num> times a game , and im always dead when i load back in . still looking for the fun part
__label__unhelpful hurry up with playground mode <emoji>
__label__helpful in the beginning this was a fun and entertaining game , but now it seems like a social standard . like , as if your not good enough at fortnite your not cool or popular . it’s really just overhyped and once you get it even if you don’t like it you feel as if you need to buy the battlepass and all the other things . just to fit in . good thing i put this game down real fast !
__label__helpful great game with so many possibilities . i have been playing this game hours upon hours its so good and its even better with friends .
__label__unhelpful every time i have to deal with people that dont use their brains . its not even funny . when you only get teamed up with people that hardly use it or even use their eyes or ears . are you in there that feel ? but . something only . i dont like . is that ? i have to put all the time .
__label__unhelpful it lags the hit detection is you get shot though walls dont buy not even worth a free game
__label__helpful in a large bowl , sift together the flour , baking powder , salt and sugar . make a well in the center and pour in the milk , egg and melted butter ; mix until smooth . heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat . pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle , using approximately <num> cup for each pancake . game isnt worth talking about , heres a pancake recipe
__label__helpful dont get me wrong , i like this edition . it runs so much more better than the java version of the game and looks better as well . but , you can clearly see it was designed for mobile devices . like what is this mojang ? you havent even touched the setting when porting it from the mobile version , we cant even change the key layout and many more things . i hope mojang will fix the entire menu and setting which is a mess at the moment (and fix the super laggy inventory) and add features which are missing , and there are lots of them as opposed to the java version , and hopefully add some more graphics options for those of us with more powerful pcs . not to mention that we cant even change our name (im stuck with the username i was using on xbox <num> years ago when i created my microsoft account) . and it bugs and tells me to buy the game when i already activated it . otherwise , i like this port , but theres a looong way to go . until then , i only give <num> stars .
__label__unhelpful this game is super addicting ! the graphics are perfect . everything is great but many things : <num> . lag , it doesnt happen often but when it happens it fks up your whole game , you cant shoot , it freezes , and the glitches are annoying . <num> . campaign isnt the greatest , dont waste money on it . <num> . battlepass switches to early <num> . party issues (disconnection , errors , lag , etc . ) <num> . <num> type of map <num> . innacurate damage <num> . vbucks are expensive (just like <num> k) <num> . reloading is slow <num> . people hack <num> . uncustomizable weapons <num> . servers are like <num> k <num> . updates are to frequent <num> . no firstperson option <num> . no enemy signal <num> . slurp juice , shotguns , and silenced pistols are overspawned <num> . to cheezy , not great elements used <num> . no vehicles . <num> . not much modes <num> . there should be an option for <num> or <num> people in a party <num> . no customizablecreator skins
__label__helpful very often the game will crash , will have frequent issues with rendering buildings and can fall through buildings on the initial drop . have been killed by staircases loading while trying to climb them . gameplay controls are horrible with no custom mapping options . have even won with a squad after a crash and was able to load back up and even though we still won never got points for the win . this game has a loooooong way to go before it is ready for release . enjoy the frustration of this game crashing multiple times in a single game and hope that you can load backkup before someone or the blue zone kills you .
__label__unhelpful i learned from the customer comments (as it wasnt included in additional information) that the reason i cant download it is that my machine is running a <num> bit version of windows . this information should have been included in the press release . prepare for lots of kids whose parents promised them the new minecraft to be really bummed .
__label__helpful i would like to know because i have a new account .
__label__unhelpful this game is money hungy , its a copy of pubg and the fanbase is toxic ! its also unfair , i will be level <num> and be put a level <num> . they stole other peoples dances and called them their own , like best mates , the og was by marlen weeb but what do they do ? they steal it as if it were their own !
__label__helpful ridiculous amounts of server issues for a game that has been out since <num> . when youre not getting constantly disconnected from matches , youre getting paired up with some kid named dank$niper <num> that team kills you over and over while he yells at his stepmom for getting pepperoni bagel bites instead of four cheese . <num> wouldnt buy again .
__label__unhelpful i have seen so many posts about this being different than java or posts like (cliffs large differences post) about it looking like it was remade rather than ported . well no duh if you were a programmer or honestly had the slightest clue about computers you would know there is a difference in programming languages . java is based and built from c++ however it isnt c++ nor as powerful at the low levels that c++ can be . this is indeed being remade , however it has a baseline they are recoding it in c++ from the original java source code base . this takes time and some revamping on some procedures , methods and classs . that being said the c++ version (windows <num> ) is far superior in performance or at the very least will be when it is all finished . currently it is still beta with features being added . this takes time to redo the entire codebase were talking millions of lines of code in fact at least <num> more than the original java version . also they are coding for virtual reality systems too .
__label__helpful first off , just bc a game is in early access and has a $ <num> price tag doesnt mean you can get away with the multitude of issues . this game is enjoyable and fun , especially with friends , but otherwise its an absolute mess . the fps is consistently low , the pop in is awful , the overall graphics and textures are that of <num> generations ago , the button layout is subpar , the game constantly crashes , and the aimingshooting mechanics are infuriating . i get its early access , but it still shouldnt be this poorly ported , and shouldnt be heavily marketed to trick unaware casuals and parents into sales , as that can be problematic . i do enjoy it and am patient for future updatesfixes , but i still have to give my honest <num> cents in the present . if you dont care about bugs and enjoy having fun then try this game . otherwise wait for a few updates .
__label__helpful loved the relaxing feeling when mining and building
__label__helpful this game is like minecraft pe , but even better . now you can play with minecraft pe players on a computer . i love the ability to play this game for free when you have the computer version . no need to worry about messing things up with your hands and fingers or elbows because now you have your keyboard . this is a huge plus for pvp server players . prepare to have amazing pvp skills . now , instead of you getting wrecked in pvp , now you can run in circles against your enemies and watch them fall to the ground ! plus , now since youve got the computer , you can repeat your commands easier . i highly recommend this game to anybody who plays minecraft . stay tuned for more amazing updates . lets go , microsoft .
__label__helpful this is a great game , but there are so many idits sending out bad reviews . any person who says it should be free , or its not the real thing , are just dumbaes and should not be listened to . all of these reasons have answers to them . <num> . mojang needs money to pay their employees to basically codedevelopimprovefix minecraft win <num> pe . if this was free they would need to stop making minecraft winpe . <num> . this is a port minecraft pe (pocket edition) for windows <num> . the description even says this is not minecraft java edition ! go on the minecraft wiki if you want too ! minecraft pe is a version of minecraft in c++ , a much faster programming language than java . mojang says that they will roll out updates on java before pewin <num> then they will apply them to other versions . thats why java has more features ! but win <num> pe are now not that far apart , and now you can barely tell the differences .
__label__helpful by far the best tactical first person shooter game ever dont quit it takes a while to learn and get good
__label__helpful better now that some bugs have been patched
__label__helpful love how you can play with pocket edition and windows <num> lan , my sibling and i play every time we have a break from school . <num>
__label__helpful mostly populated by a bunch of douchebag try hards . me and freinds that play are casual players and
__label__unhelpful the game has little lag and you can tell the creators love their game but even still its the developers seem to want to cater to new players . shotguns were nerfed so that beginers wouldnt be killed as fast . materials are even harder to collect so that players dont have to worry about enemies outbuilding them . c <num> is very powerfull so that if you are getting outbuilt you can knock it all down and reset the playing field . smgs were buffed so that if you arent accurate at all you could still spray and pray . llamas were nerfed severely so that materials are harder to come by . rockets were removed from llamas and capped so that if you were a slow builder you didnt need to worry about an endless barage of rockets and according to rummors there is going to be a materials cap so that expert builders cant do as much . they are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side show . but its not all bad knews . you can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of <num> $ .
__label__unhelpful best game in along time
__label__unhelpful i like how its free and all but it makes it free so you can spend money in game kids get addicted to skins even though just sticking to default is fine and plus if you waste youre money on skins theres a chance you might be seen in combat so whats the point of buying it im here to say this game is trash and its my opinion
__label__helpful ok so this games damage system is bad . when im in point blank range with a tac shotgun i should do high damage but thats not the case . i just got done with a match and i had <num> health and a green tac shotty and my enemy had <num> and a ar and i get a headshot and did <num> damage and got raped .
__label__helpful i love minecraft . its free roam (the entire point of the game) , and but you can also play with restrictions (survival) . and i do like the new additions (horses , saddles , etc) . however i feel that the next update should bring stained glass panes . ive had to use plain panes for a while , and i must admit theyre extremely boring . i might buy the old minecraft just for the stained panes . theyre classy and i like them . also , we have to pay for texture packs ? you made us pay for the game , isnt that enough ? i understand that money has to be brought in somehow , but players make texture packs , and they dont charge anything . smh , if i wanted to pay for a texture pack i would go buy blocklauncher pro .
__label__helpful games community is toxic and weapons are unbalanced and i suggest paying for pubg because at least thats not toxic .
__label__helpful fortnites pve has decent rewards and a player can earn legendary guns and v bucks which are quite useful for many purposes . pve sadly is quite buggy at high level missions and many newcomers will ask and beg for free items which can be rather annoying . fortnite pvp lately has been focused on their greed for money . (tragic . ) constantly releasing cosmetics and skins instead of addressing lag , crashing , and horrible gun imbalances is rather sad epic games . just another large game company taking advantage of kids w their parents credit card . i recommend far cry <num> , battlefield <num> , or star wars bf <num> . not p <num> p and rather enjoyable . warning : if you dont sweat extremely hard every single match until you have a stroke , fortnite battle royale is not for you . i hope my detailed review was useful to you , best of luck ! updated : double pump is back pretty much why ! no skill to this game at all just build spam or hide . play something else , honestly . go outside maybe .
__label__helpful in rainbow six siege , its not a rushing and killing game . it requires stealth and waiting to get a kill because everyone gets <num> life per round and this is what i like about the game . another thing i like about the game is if you are frustrated at multiplayer or want to have fun , you can play terrorist hunt with your friends . the things i dont like about this game is team killing especially when im trying to do something and teamates get in the way and you accidentally kill them or accidentally destroy their gadgets witch they might get mad and kill you . another thing i dont like this makes sense but , is if someone chooses a operator you want to be , you cant be that operator for the round . besides the things i dont like , its pretty worth the money if you ask me .
__label__helpful havnt been this excited for a game in a while !
__label__unhelpful fix your broken game . <num> damage headshots face to face with a rare pump shotgun . you have to land at named areas to get good loot . i feel your hitpoints for gun damage is randomized . the graphics are decent , cosmetics are ok , overall gameplay is below average , and the theme for season <num> is lame . make <num> v <num> a standard game mode . overall , the game is pretty bad . the servers are . mw <num> has better servers than this game
__label__unhelpful microsoft installed without my permission
__label__unhelpful i admit i thought at <num> st trash game but since then i have purchased the xbox one x and a <num> k television and now the game looks and plays amazingly well if your on or have this game and are running it from the <num> yr old out dated xbox one you are not a happy customer and if you have yet to buy pubg and dont have the current xbox system (((wait))) untill this game is a finish product its truly not made right now to be played on a <num> yr old xbox it looks and plays like $µ ! t compared to playing on the most powerful game console to date it is night and day and if you invest in xbox trust me put down the cash on a <num> k television its a must have accessory then and only then buy pubg . i am pointing out this game is the best br type game out on currentnewest console and on a <num> k television it can and does handle <num> frps with perfection and very little to zero console crashing <num> out of <num> .
__label__unhelpful all this game is , is a big money grab . it makes it free but makes it so that youll play it but makes it so that youll have to spend real money to get better things and this game is built on that . along with that this game has no original ideas and relys heavly on mirotransactions to thee point where you will spend lost of mony on this
__label__unhelpful worried about fortnite more than their own game . i try to come back and give it a second chance from the mushy buildings and poor performance but i literally cant get in the game . press a to reconnect but nothing happens . i looked into solutions but there was nothing . i uninstalled and reinstalled and it didnt work . this is borderline robbery because i cant play the game i payed for . want a suggestion ? play fortnite because they address their games issues to the public and they dont whine when someone takes their idea and makes it better .
__label__helpful i cant play one f°°°°°° match without lagging <num> , i move one inch an get thrown around like a frickin rag doll , would i recommend this game ? no , it sucks more than a stripper on a dollar tuesday
__label__helpful the game has gotten better with these last updates . it seems to run smoother even in <num> v <num> , that gamtype i lagged alot , it was so bad people were invisible . i still get annoyed with bloom shots but its whatever , just weird you can hit someone and not do damage ? cool thing is that you guys update frequently and add new things to the game . the challenges are a big plus as well !
__label__helpful great game it really is but after the <num> gb update was supposed to fix that but i guess not and i uninstalled the game and then reinstalled but still crashes so still expect the game crashes after the <num> gb update update it lags bad and doesnt render buildings fast enough die too many times to lags so was <num> star but now im giving it <num> now
__label__helpful i didnt know i was paying to be an epicgames beta tester . this game would be fun if it wasnt broken . the constant crashing needs a fix asap . if youre on the fence about this game here are some things you should know . its pay to win . its not finished and still very broken . it comes out free to play next summer . so save your money unless you want to be a beta tester as well .
__label__unhelpful the game requires you to listen to your surroundings and keep a watchful eye out for other players . that wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for the amount of lag that comes with it . preventing sniper shots , sneak attacks , fair firefights . not to mention audio cuts that prevent you from hearing other players . there is also some poor damage consistency where you could use the same weapon as another , hit each other in the head but youll be the one to die and hell escape basically unharmed
__label__helpful i love this game but i want it to be like java edition , i heard that the update might be coming out soon maybe in december but i just cant wait , the <num> . <num> . <num> update was awesome but i expect more , im happy that we get end city with the end together , i wish it is coming , awesome games are infinite , just like minecraft .
__label__helpful heads up , review of br only ive seen lots of <num> star reviews for stupid reasons , and <num> star reviews for just as pissy reasons . so here we go ! cons to pros ! cons toxic and childish fanbase bad balancing v <num> rgin bucks requires real money to many old glitches its ez to get in a match with tryhards or kid noobs pros ok weapons cool unlockables nice map not p <num> w overall fortnite is just bad , the cons are bad and nothing is memorable . <num>
__label__unhelpful ok the loading screen takes forever to load it takes <num> : <num> go load thats longer than gta v ok now the lag like i havd really good wifi and i still lag its really bad lag like really bad ive died so much times of lag that its unbelieveable but anythin else the game is fine
__label__helpful little issues (except fps is a little low) but not bad
__label__helpful so you look at it , and its missing quite a few things . but it runs amazingly well on my desktop , and playable on my lousy laptop . : ) will it ever replace the java version ? maybe not , but it gives a great playable version to the masses . just remember that as of me writing this , its a beta and not finished , and you can easily understand any niggling issues with it .
__label__helpful great game but some people are just too toxic
__label__unhelpful hopefully we would see playeruknowns battleground soon ! <emoji>
__label__helpful i like the game and it is really good . i think they should add a multiplayer button so we can go on servers or just play with friends . i also liked the path feature in the villages . one problem that i know is in the actual game though , is that iron golems attack you even if you accidently hit a villager . also , im not sure if this is a glitch , but the iron golem killed me , and when i came back into the village , it killed me again . they should also add the pirate speak language to the game . i also noticed that most of the features are from pe edition , like the fallen trees . another thing is that in the trial , you cant do any sort of customization for your world . these ware all the problems , but everything else is running perfect and smooth . i love it !
__label__helpful the gameplay for this game is really fun and addicting but some controls have a hard time working such as picking up team mates . crashing is much less than before when it first came out and disabling captures helps with processing on a standard xbox one . (settings>preferences>captures and broadcast) actions also do not seem very quick to do or change such as picking up items , opening doors , or changing car seats to name a few . cameras are jittery in cars and could use a little smoother motion .
__label__unhelpful its straight garbage . minecraft is better than this !
__label__unhelpful when is cross platform with xbox one going to release ?
__label__helpful i cant really buy anything like minecoins will you please do something about it please and thank you !
__label__helpful great work mojang on making minecraft : windows <num> edition beta closer every time to the java version , this game is really addictive and fun . thanks for all the hard work you guys into this ! : d
__label__helpful good so far on day <num>
__label__unhelpful completely awful hit detection and imbalanced weapons . provides no unlockable content or reason to continue to play .
__label__helpful cant trust reviews on here anymore . folks giving bad reviews because they didnt read the description that this is part of a game preview that is currently under development and will get better in time . just look at pc version .
__label__helpful this will be a short review . i understand that this is just the beta version and that more features are going to be released . i do enjoy creative mode just for the sake of building whatever i like , and i like the survival and the huge , vast landscape that you can play in . i have been having lots of fun with this so far . i only have one issue with this version so far . i have no problem with setting blocks down when im moving , but when im building or attacking something , i have to be completely immobile in order to strike anything . this is a bit tedious and frustrates me a little , especially since i really enjoy speed and convenience .
__label__helpful as a pocket edition and pc edition player , this bring the two together and is nearly perfect , it has the ability to play with your xbox friends , take screenshots and more win just a couple of clicks , as an owner of nearly all the minecraft editions im happy to add this to my collection especially for free : p , hope this version turns out well and happy playing ! note : multiplayer is not realeased until this is out of beta
__label__helpful love the new ocean workup and im almost eager to see those wraith things come for me . is that bad ? oh well . beautiful game ! only could you mayyyybe consider making it compatible for mods ? ive been wanting to try out the aether mod for a long time now . also minor detail , but do you think you could fix the issue that doesnt let things stack if i rightclick them out of a chest ? thanks !
__label__helpful dont listen to all these pansys complaining about the game having bug , saying stuff . they dont know what theyre talking about . all of you are just people who suck at the game . if youve ever played arma <num> or arma <num> then this game is for you , yeah , its having a little bugs because it just launched about a week ago hey company that is on its own this game gives me all of the pvps back . so i could ask for sure , it needs a little more of the reward system . yeah , i could see that , but from here all aspects of with the game is it is great , its intense . it never lets up on that sensation that you might be shot by a sniper or wondering if youre safe because truly the only place youre safe is the main menu i love this game and for those who complain about the game because its not perfect well . i dont see you making a game now , so shove it .
__label__helpful i like the game because its more realistic than fortnite , but i would wait until the game is fixed because right now the game is super buggy . example : i was dropping in at a location and the game hadnt loaded in the the stuff inside the building . i walk in and i get stuck in between these benches and die from falling . overall i would wait until the game is fixed .
__label__unhelpful having a smallish map with <num> people is ridiculous , along with this there are sometimes where you would land right in the beginning and walk into a house to see someone already in there with a shotgun that one shots you . this hasnt happened once or twice its like every <num> games you will have this problem . along with this the rng is very annoying , you could be at some place like anarcy acres where you can search a house to only get bullets and bandages but the other house gets a green shotgun , <num> white rifle and some grenades . furthermoreif you survivehe first <num> minutes , i hope you have fun running around trying to either find people to kill or some better gear . the only good feeling you can get is from winning everything else will be frustration . i hoped you liked this review overall if youre good at pvp then have at it . but if not then dont bother keeping this game in the storage in your xbox one . update : the game has become overrated and its minecraft survival games wguns
__label__helpful great game ! well done ! all of the work theyve done to allow all devices to play with each other is amazing !
__label__helpful its great if you just wanna chill out and pass time
__label__helpful ok , so im gonna be completely honest here . i have pretty bad internet and this game still runs honestly smoother than i though it was gonna run ! ive only encountered a few problems with little lag spikes sometimes and some rendering issues when you first drop into the map , other than that , a few black screens that dashboarded me (but most times you can load back in if youre quick) , clunky controls (which i got used to so now they arent bad) , the game is fun asf ! now the game is still in early access , i know , but it has a good system setup with plenty of cousomization and loot to find on the battlefield , plus loot crates you can purchase to customize your character more ! the gitches it has will be sorted soon im sure but like i said , not that many ive had a problem with . im enjoying the game a ton as it is so im excited to see this game progress with updatescontent over the coming months ! thanks and peace <emoji>
__label__helpful everytime i try to play it it just crashes it doesnt even start
__label__helpful got the game going ehh ok lets try it . <num> hours later im still playing . takes shoot and loot and mixes in base deffence wich is actualy very awsome just took me a sec to get used to but in the end its great <num> $ is well well worth it im doubt ill be putting this game down for a week straight <num> addicting .
__label__helpful foreal fix this stupid crashing ish . it is aggravating me to my core man .
__label__unhelpful but the people hating , are playing the wrong mode . pvp is trash .
__label__helpful i love minecraft windows <num> ect . its amazing , so much fun , survival or creative , one thing they should add is spectator mode and hardcore mode , that would make the game more challaging , also , i love that you dont need internet for your skin to load ! that is my favorite part , there is also cool tricks that windows <num> has that mcpe dint have , like pick a block with your scroll wheel : d
__label__unhelpful if i could do zero stars i would . <num> games in a row on start game crashed . and they probably . dont plan to fix it dont buy wase of money unless its a <num> $game then id say go for it .
__label__helpful if you intend on also playing on pc buyplay , and link your account on pc first . if you play on xbox first epic will lock this game to xbox only . it doesnt even matter if you bought the game for both . epic will only tell you to make a second account . so , for those of us who play epics other games such as unreal tournament or paragon they expect us to create a secondary account just to play fortnite on pc . tl : dr link and play fortnite on pc first or you will have to create a second epic account .
__label__helpful this game won game of the year on pc , and thats where it should have stayed . game is hardly compatible with the xbox , and get the xbox one x for <num> fps . are you out of your mind ? its <num> , i should expect to get <num> fps on console , not <num> yearold laptop quality . i mistakenly spent $ <num> ($ <num> per fps) on this game , and i hope whoever reads this wont make the same mistake i did . the firstperson playlist wont save this game . and i havent even mentioned the lag and disconnects . this was a moneysnatching grab , nothing more . stick with fortnite people . update : just because it says <num> complete doesnt make the issues it has acceptable update <num> : gun fights up close are desynching crap
__label__helpful i had issues , but the game is awesome now
__label__helpful fast pace game . challenging at moments but its enjoyable . exept for the trolling
__label__unhelpful the replays show a different clip from wat really happens , the aim assist . in this game is to crazy , has had tons of updates but the multiplayer is still in beta after <num> or <num> years of being out wat is goin on , get killed wen u move out of the line of sight , long story short its addictive but not worth it to a real shooter
__label__helpful rainbow <num> siege is a fantastic game built for people who take games a bit more seriously but still want the casual fun . however the dislikes i have arent about griefing or trolls , my dislike is how every update seems to have a balance between good and bad . by that i mean say ubisoft fixed a problem thats been around for ages , yet when they do the start of a new to possibly more detrimental bug is exposed . so i do enjoy the game , ill play for hours at a time , but this game can definitely be better if it was better taken care of .
__label__unhelpful what i like about mc is the fact that you are aloud to go into creative mode and do anything . what i dont like about mc is the price for the real game . $ <num> ? my dad wont let me get it because it costs $ <num> ! another thing i dont like is that in the trial you arent aloud to go in creative . other than that , i am fine with this game forever . i also want you to update it really fast to be like the real pc version . plus this acts like pe on my computer because my computer is touch screen so , ya . if you update this game fast enough to reach <num> . <num> . <num> in a year , i will keep playing this once my computer is fixed . it wont let me download it to my computer because of avastfreeantivirus or this game is updating .
__label__unhelpful pubg players triggered cuz their game on xbox is complete trash nd fortnite is doing everything right pubg is dead hello fortnite <emoji>
__label__unhelpful in app purchases are no good . for this reason and this reason alone i give it a <num> . nearly everything else is great or too soon in development to tell . things are different , but thats to be expected . i love that it is clean and fast . to the developers : <num> . ) i dont like the zfighting that occurs when a block is highlighted . the java version handled this perfectly using a wireframe highlight . <num> . ) particles disperse nicely except in confined spaces where they bunch up against the wall and fill the working screen real estate . perhaps consider making particles smaller and causing them to bounce off walls ? <num> . ) in app purchases . these hurt consumer confidence especially when making something based on a beloved game that was built entirely with consumerfirst thinking . dont do it ! <num> . ) so far so good ; i really like it . just dont fall into a moneyfirst mindset . im sure you remember how that worked out with the xbox one pr nightmare . i certainly do .
__label__helpful this tom clancy title is one of if not the best one , for new comers its brutal due to the matchmakings nature witch pits greenies with seasoned vets (needs improvement) . as for glitches go it truly pitiful witch is to be expected with such a competitive game players are always looking for was to get one step ahead of others , but with the new season blood orchid i and manny others hope the game is takeing a step in the right direction with <num> + bugglitch fixes and revision of the engine . so now for the big question is it worth your hard earned money ? in my opinion yes , its a great game even though it needs improvement the devs are always hard at work improving it so if you do deside to buy tom clancys rainbow six siege sitck with it and i am sure you will enjoy it . p . sprays chanka <emoji>
__label__helpful i actually dont have the complete version yet , but its been really fun and making me want to buy it . overall its super fun and cant wait until i can get multiplayer ! and then ill blow up everything with tnt ! but i really wish there were command blocks ! i hope mojang fixes this but overall its a great game ! (also i have the game now) p . s . it turns out that blowing up stuff with tnt makes people angry so i kinda stopped doing it . i just really hope that the game gets another game update with command blocks ! because if this game finally gets command blocks . i would love the game so much ! but sadly , there arent command blocks which is unfair since some minecraft versions have them but <num> . <num> . <num> doesnt ! sigh . i really super duper hope that mojang makes another update . the update came on <num> and im so happy ! but now the only thing that would be cool is to have it updated to <num> . <num> . <num> because i found out it has a bunch of awesome things .
__label__unhelpful needs work but shows potential .
__label__helpful i think what yall have done is gr <num> bc its better then buying the game again with season pass . also shows yall have faith into evolving the experience more and making it more challenging . also try to work out these kinks a little more with the servers and glitches . please and thank u <num> a incredible , realistic , game ! <emoji>
__label__helpful hands down my most played game i own on any of my platforms but the matchmaking mechanics prevent it from being <num> stars . i can not count the number of times i have been kicked from an online ranked match to then not be given the option to rejoin . in any other game id shrug it off but in this one you lose ranking and get hit with a <num> minute ban for their poor servers . speaking of the servers , they are pretty frequently down (like today) , or having maitenance being done which is pretty frustrating for a game that has no campaign and is almost completely multiplayer only . all that said , i will be playing this game until those servers crash completely or are turned off because i only hate all the server issues because it prevents me from being able to play more .
__label__helpful the best fun i had . and gotta love the free dlc .
__label__unhelpful if you dont like it go back to playing fortnite ! . itlagstoomuch itcosttoomuch . be patient
__label__helpful this is a great game but its that people are toxic and will kill you for picking a character some one wanted .
__label__helpful this version is amazing . it has cross play which is important . it is an extremely well optimized minecraft that is slowly catching up to java edition . one downside is that the amount of pew <num> e servers out there are very few . the ones that are out there have few few updated features . that being said , this is an awesome version overall to just play normal survival on .
__label__helpful this is the best game for kids it helps them build and use there imagination
__label__helpful i did played fortnite , but oh boy this game make me dying easy myself because i never played battle player unknown and of course fortnite . not interested this game . <emoji>
__label__helpful i like building and how u build stuff
__label__helpful they need to remove team killing <num> of casual games are you getting tkd and ranked hardly ever finds a game
__label__unhelpful was able to play one game of battle royal then i quit out to watch youtube , then flash forward <num> hours and i launch the game , then <num> windows pop up , a were loading fortnite please wait , then it says cant download uninstall something else then try again , which is really frustrating as i have <num> gb free and the game itself has been installeddeleted many times as well as other stuff(gamesapps) but same experience every time . fix this problem please
__label__unhelpful looks like a <num> . no contols layout for newbs . no options menu period . <num> fps at best . mad i bought this pos
__label__helpful i love the game , so happy to see it on xbox ! i just wish there was less frame lag and if it had button mapping that would help . overall its a great buggy game of extraordinary proportions ! update : the patches seem to be helping . now if we could organize loot better and stop game crashes at the end of squad matches that would be nice . keep up the good work ! <emoji> ⚔ <emoji>
__label__helpful i love the game but ever since the newest update that disabled shopping carts whenever i go to the area around the bridge near flush , and flush the game freezes and shuts down . please fix soon
__label__helpful i like the fact of it being challenging but there are some people that dont get used to its flaws every game has one or more but there are glitches and trolls and there are people that go afk or disconnect but you just need to wait and then you have fun do not start on ranked .
__label__helpful the devolopers are steadilly working on making the game hard rather generating any sort of content . after playing stonewood nothing changes except for higher lvl enemies . this is a pay to win game do not buy it ! <emoji>
__label__helpful the app was working perfectly before last update , i updated like a week ago and since yesterday it was working good , now i cant even open the app , i start it and after <num> min of wait in the mojang logo the app crashs , i didnt give it a bad star review because is a good game and i love it but right now im not happy because of this bug . please fix it . another thing is there are random texture bugs in the game , like you can see trough the blocks and see caves and underground stuff and also there is a bug in the sky in the afternoon and at night if you look in to a specific direction the sky will become complete black and the stars and clouds will disappear . i will try reinstalling the game if it doesnt work i will send mojang an email .
__label__helpful i love the game because it help you relax the brain . if you get stress get on minecraft and it will help . totally worth the money .
__label__helpful epicgames needs to give xbox players a free skin .
__label__unhelpful it reminds me too much of the mobile version , which seriously bothers me with the way its set up . i like the other minecraft version more , its menu system and stuff is set up better i think .
__label__helpful great game but give us free skins too
__label__helpful save your cash for the retail release . they sold so many early access copies that they should have plenty of cash to throw at all the bugs . if they dont soon , youll know what kind of company this is . all youre missing in the meantime is a game that rubberbands like crazy and crashes often .
__label__helpful i like that we can as many people and win but i hate the lag
__label__helpful sweet needs updates but when they do i will be great . waiting lobby needs tons of work
__label__unhelpful take the new minigun out its not even fair when using it against others bases . this game is trash . how do you hit someone thats right in front of you for <num> health with a green pump . (the best gun it the game . )
__label__unhelpful i hate it ! it keeps asking me to connect to xbox live and i dont want to i just want to play like my computer . i hate it eve after purchasing everything its locked for xbox wtfffff
__label__helpful get used to people teamkilling you because they have nothing better to do . ive been killed by my teammates more than my enemies . good scam , its too late to get a refund now . <emoji> ubisoft is dead to me
__label__unhelpful the windows <num> version of minecraft was an amazing idea and its really fun . now , the bad part . i found a small bugissue when you climb vine , the sound you hear is like when you climb a ladder . other than that , there just needs to be more minor bug fixes and this will be an amazing addition to the versions of minecraft .
__label__helpful on my xbox one it is awesome , but when i searched fortnite battle royale on my computer in the microsoft store , it said you owe this app and i went to start i did not see it . do you think you can help ?
__label__unhelpful they need to fix the hit box and need some form of macth making for casual (mabey by level and k . d)
__label__unhelpful i love the game i just want save the world for free
__label__helpful update to <num> stars : some combination of computer and game updates means i can play now ! : ) its slow and a little glitch , but thats beta for you . if i could remap my movement controls on my keyboard id give you <num> stars . being right handed , i dont like the movement keys being locked to the left side of my keyboard . id love to be able to map the movements to my number pad . <num> star review : if i could play , id rate you . i got the trial and it opened just fine , but when i saw it had only <num> minutes of game time i decided to just buy it . closed the app , went to the store , bought it , never able to open it again . i can see the mojang logo all day , but thats it . hurray , lol .
__label__helpful my one issue is lack of proximity chat . i hope the creators listen here . this key feature is a staple in the pc version , one that both brings the community together and underlines stressful moments in hilarious ways . it will be disappointing to not receive that small detail . this game has caught so much flack its insane . look at gta online , when it first came out it was utter trash , but now years later its straight <emoji> . good things take time , so be patient with blue hole . they are constantly putting out updates as promised . yes , the game still crashes every few matches . yes , the rendering is still rough while landing , giving us playdough like masses for buildings at a most critical moment in our race to get the first gun . anyone who is familiar with the pc version can tell you we will get the royale treatment in time . so please give them credit and stop hating because you keep dying lol . if u cant handle this go play fortnight . you know . that offbrand crap u see drake play . <emoji>
__label__helpful got it as a freebie for owning the pc version (good on you ms) . runs great for the most part , still missing some main branch addins , but performance over the java version is way better . xbox app integration needs some work , and at least two issues i have noticed . app crashes if you alttab to another window after a few seconds , without fail , and theres no clean way to exit the app short of alt+f <num> , or clicking x . plus : achievements xbox integration runs much better than java minus : a few bugs still not as up to date overall , great for the fair price of free . <num> . <num>
__label__helpful horrible lag on decent connection , unplayable . no issues with other games .
__label__helpful it runs so smoothly and every single update makes it better . good job !
__label__unhelpful very challenging game , communication is a must . time spent learning the game is very rewarding in the long run . great game just be ready to invest some time to get the full sweaty palm <num> round edge of your seat expirence .
__label__helpful i like the game it looks like it will work out , but there are some features that are needed that are important . you cant use an anvil while in creative and you cant move and attackbreak blocks at the same time . other than that it is very nice . i hope that you improve upon these features soon , especially the part where you cant attack or break blocks while moving . if ficed will rate five stars . also freezes up a lot .
__label__unhelpful this game is a pure joke and certainly not worth $ <num> ! even playing with the xbox one x and a <num> k tv you cant make the difference between a tree and a potential other player , and the lag is terrible considering the fact that i do have fiber inernet in my house ! now keep in mind that pubg is so frugal and so dirt cheap that after playing way over an hour in order to save money and buy your first crate , it is very likely that you will be rewarded with a pink shirt , which is really helpful to survive against aks and rpgs . right ? worse loot system in the video game history ! this game is nothing but a total rippoff and a scam well designed to steal money from us honest players . do not buy !
__label__unhelpful wont let me update to <num> . <num> , so i tried uninstalling and reinstalling , but when i click install it just says sorry , something happened at our end
__label__helpful i cant believe how many times where i know im gonna win a gun fight or times when im trying to be stealthy and out of nowhere the game decides to screw me over by lagging to death (literally) and it just makes me so mad . and to top it off with a slap in my face , you guys remember the tournament that the winner of <num> , <num> dollars won because he used glitches to win . everybody knows damn well that money could have went into better servers . im so disappointed with this game at the fact that it even is as much as it cost . i would have never bought this game if i knew how bad its performance was .
__label__unhelpful the game itself is solid for a game made by modders but the crashing can happen multiple times in a single game , it doesent help that the cars act randomly and lag makes the game unplayable . i would not recommend buying this game until many many patches into the future . if you really want a battle royal game just get fortnite , its not as good but not broken .
__label__unhelpful wish it worked with <num> bit but having no issues on my <num> bit machines .
__label__helpful lag fest , camp fest , and guns arent programmed right , go pubg
__label__unhelpful clearly you cannot fullscreen , or unlock your framerate . this will make some players experience input delay from mice , so i do feel that is a worthwhile change . but if you simply change the aspect ratio of your window to a skinnierwider rectangle your fov is effectively much wider .
__label__helpful i love this game but with <num> hours i have logged onto this game i can tell you that the community is super toxic , matchmaking is absolutely broken and the game is still infected with the same issues its had for months and years .
__label__helpful cant put controller down . this game is totally awesome , addicting , and challenging !
__label__unhelpful this game is fun i love it im just soo addicted : )
__label__helpful this game is amazing . even after two years , it still gets updated with new content . the matches are all about strategy and wit , with a good reason to aim for the head . the learning curve is a bit steep , however , if you can commit the time to learn and practice , youll have an incredibly rewarding experience .
__label__helpful great game but the number of times it crashes is nearly unbearable . crashes atleast once an hour and occasionally twice in one game
__label__unhelpful this game is gay , very gay .
__label__unhelpful it is a game we get to play before its finished your paying <num> the beta and to give ways to make it better it will frequently update be a lil buggy etc but if you bout this not knowing it was going to have some flaws your an idiot do me reasearch b <num> crying about it further more this gam was designed <num> pc so yeah the controls are going to be a lil tuff to master get good plain and simple this game is alot fun alot of laughs and oh moment well worth <num>
__label__helpful ive been holding my breath hoping that pubg would come to console at all . ill gladly pay <num> bucks to play whilst its still in development . anyone complaining of early access woes just has a sandy vjj . <emoji> game performs fine on xbox onex .
__label__helpful update <num> : game still crashes . rubberbanding is better but not great . terrible hit detection . rendering is slightly better but still not great . the game needs to be renamed playerunknowns battleground , marathon trainer & dress up game . more clothes than weapons . enhanced for xbox one x translates to crashes slightly less but renders better . i wish i had waited to get this game . i was very excited when i heard it was coming to console but i am already over the frustration . the bp point system is ridiculous . top notch players get maybe <num> k per round . cheapest crate is <num> . do the math . opened three consecutive boxes and got the same pair of school shoes x <num> . framerate is better but still bad . this game would look ok if released in <num> . vehicles are improved as far as damage when riding but motorcycles are twitchy again . flip for no reason . invisible walls . plane door is closed now . i prefer it open there is still a long way to go before this preview is complete . money grab ?
__label__helpful i like the game its so awesome
__label__helpful i love everything thing about this game the only thing they need to work on is the rendering it takes awhile for everything to load in the map properly
__label__helpful crashes a whole lot less with update !
__label__unhelpful green screen of death and the funny thing is it was working <num> months ago maby external video settings may work hint hint
__label__helpful if youre a regular pc player like me , i would not recommend . i understand this is more for consolemobile players to be able to play on their pcs , and thats fine , but it just doesnt compete with the real thing . it feels like walking backwards in time with missing features and lack of customization . no custom keybindings is a big problem for me . the interface feels clunky and not very intuitive . i hope there are no intentions of having this replace the real pc version of the game down the road , it would be a huge mistake .
__label__unhelpful this game is a lot of fun but it does lack in some spaces like the creative menu .
__label__helpful this game is going to implode sooner or later .
__label__helpful we have encountered some glitches since down loading the game but everyone does seem to be working hard to resolve them . it takes longer then i would like for customer service follow up , but they do and they even check back when they are pretty sure problem has been resolved . as far as the game its self its pretty awesome the hole family plays from age <num> great version of mind craft so much better then the pocket addition .
__label__helpful considering this game came out less than <num> hours ago and everyone is playing , it actually runs pretty good . on top of that , i saw multiple server annoucements on hot fixs and such . obvious a game like this starts buggy , but its nice knowing the devs are trying to keep things under control . also , won the <num> th match i was in . thank you shotgun .
__label__helpful please add <num> bit support ! i would love to play it but i cant : (
__label__helpful my son and i both enjoy playing this game , especially together , with one of us on the android version and one on the windows <num> version . i did have a situation come up where the save was corrupted , so i had to completely wipe my sons profile and restart his game , but that seemed to be a bit of a fluke . everything else seems to work great , and with each update , there are more and more features . it keeps getting better , and keeps getting closer to complete . im glad i purchased it .
__label__helpful guys thiss game isnt finished but its very addictive . i love this title and most of the complaints i see are from people who dont know the control layout .
__label__helpful i cant play it , every time i load it , it shows the mojang logo and then just quits out
__label__helpful bluehole has put pubg xbox on the backburner since <num> . <num> , but they made sure microtransactions worked perfectly .
__label__helpful first off i wanna start by saying that i love siege ! i love the tactical moments and teamwork that can be used , gun play is fun except for when you completely obliterate ash but the gods swoop down and pick her up to crack a random head shot . but the main reason im making this is it to say operation health is the biggest pile of trash ive ever seen . they have completely broken the health and bullet mechanics ! which has completely ruined my experience for this update ! knowing that this is a ubisoft game and its on xbox , i know there wont be any updates to fix most of the stuff that is broken any time soon . even with an update im sure theyll just break more stuff .
__label__helpful i really like the music it so relax ! the graphic looks amazing . i really like survival mode . but the thing i dont like about this game is it look so similar to the pocket edition version making the game a bit boring . you should add some more of the pc version . because this cost <num> $ and pe cost <num> $ only . make it beterrrrr
__label__unhelpful gamers like it and dont like , so why not ? <emoji>
__label__helpful great team based first person shooter very realistic unlike cod . all the different operators are very unique . this game is awesome .
__label__unhelpful fortnite is the hottest game out but there are a few problems with this game . for example pumps does <num> damage up close and they also should fix the lagging problem other than that this is a really good game <emoji>
__label__helpful sorry , ill keep my soul .
__label__unhelpful so theres team kills trolls killing then quitting so they dont get penalized . you can accidently kill teammates multiple times takes one bullet , c <num> , grenade , charge and all because they want to run in your line sight . then you get penalized which only goes up . i got ban <num> min . first time <num> days later another accident <num> hours i read reviews about penalty and now im deleting the game because that is total b . s . i make sure i tried my hardest not to teamkill but it cant always be helped with something that is meant to be fast paced and people with no skill thinking they are rambo its going to happen and youre at fault . how does a company ban you from a game you pay for to begin with ? so i spend my hard earned money to basically help your company grow to not being able to play cause you say so tell me how does that make sense . reknown system takes forever unless you spend more of your money . to new people dont buy a game that you cant play freely . this is one of them !
__label__helpful this game is horrible . it is just a game full of trolls and confusion . never be friends with people who friends unless you know them !
__label__helpful a really great game especially for the creative mind !
__label__unhelpful the game doesnt include some featuresaspects of the vanilla pc release (such as modsfree texture packsdedicated servers) , but the switch from java to c++ makes the game run far , far better than any previous release to date . if you are willing to overlook some feature omissions , youll probably find this to be the most enjoyable way to play minecraft . also , includes full xbox <num> controller support !
__label__helpful game crashes every time i start a match . if someone doesnt kill me before it boots back up , its a lot of fun .
__label__helpful the game is fun and heart racing , but being teamkilled then kicked from a ranked match as soon as the round starts is complete bs that should be fixed asap .
__label__unhelpful still experience some lagging and game crashes but improving weekly .
__label__helpful the game feels so stiff and clunky
__label__unhelpful freezes way to much . reminds me of the old school nintendo console . then it opens a random app . im not sure if its the game or the xbox , but my other games dont do this
__label__helpful great game a must have . not for the casual cod player . this game is not repetitive at all !
__label__unhelpful minecraft for windows <num> 终于回归，但是为什么我要登录xbox live 却登录不了呢！导致不能玩多人了！xbox live 不能使用的话，为什么不直接让我们登录minecraft的正版账号呢
__label__unhelpful i got this because i wanted to install mods for my pc but it turns out you cant and i want a refund
__label__helpful im sure there are bugs ive not run into yet , however thus far the conversion to c++ has been fine . (and more secure than java , i might add . ) the cross platform play is something that many gamers have been asking for in many games for some time now , so that is a huge plus . i love the multiple options for controls being a gamer on both pc and console , i love the easy access of keyboardmouse while playing on my laptop while still being able to kick back with an xbox <num> controller when i hook the laptop up to my tv . overall , im happy that i migrated to the new win <num> beta so far keep it up ms !
__label__helpful so far its not bad , the frames drop from time to time but it still isnt fully release so it ok
__label__unhelpful this game is nothing but a poor attempt to copy pubg in a cartoonish fashion . that needs to stop to give pu the rights to this type of game . that means take this game off xbl and sue epic
__label__helpful its all about if you drop in and get the pump at the start . or else youll get blasted by it bc no gun not even the scar can beat it within <num> m onestly ive given up on the hope for them ever maaking this game fair bc it keeps getting worse
__label__helpful after patch <num> game runs pretty well now very nice
__label__helpful i love how this game is nicely put together , and it is exactly like the pocket edition . however , maybe they should add trading with villagers . besides that , its an awesome game .
__label__unhelpful although an unorigonal idea still much enjoyable . your first win feels amazing btw <emoji> <emoji> ⚔⚔⚔⚔ <emoji> <emoji> ♻
__label__helpful playing on xb <num> (standard ) still consistent pixelated houseshouses , takes about <num> seconds to load the environment . the shooting still needs to be adjusted a little bit .
__label__helpful like pubg but . you know , its free
__label__helpful i absolutely loved siege up until ubisoft decided to be the laziest and greediest scum out there . theyve decided to censor certain elements in everyones copy of siege so that itll be commie china friendly . ubisoft for forcing commie chinas backwards censorship on people who dont even live in china . weve put up with bs since y <num> and this is the last straw . hopefully theyll see the error of thier ways and fix this . its rated m for fcksake
__label__helpful the game is great . its what every person that has a bad pc and wants to play pubg wants . issues . at the the start of the game there is rubber banding and stuff doesnt load very fast so graphic problems) but there is one reason that this game is worth over looking the crashes . ( in my opinion) when the game crashes freezes you can join back if you dont die . i think the devs need to make it so when your game crashes you dont move . ive lost many friends to this . update <num> or so month after the game came out : i think they have improved lag a lot . and my , my game doesnt crash . this game has constant updates . and just received fpp . i recommend it
__label__unhelpful join the pubg master race
__label__helpful this game is so fun
__label__unhelpful great to play with my friends all over the world
__label__unhelpful its not everything the internet hypes it to be . if this isnt your cup of tea then dont play it
__label__helpful i personally enjoy this game , the gameplay is great besides the major lag that needs fixed , i mean those really negative reviews out there are not needed , rating this magnificent game a <num> or <num> is not needed a <num> or <num> fits it better i would recommend this game to others if they can handle lag spikes but this game has really good potentially it just needs a minor cleaning of things .
__label__helpful i started playing pubg around the end of february <num> , but as of november <num> , i am no longer playing pubg anymore due to technical problems , performance issues , decline in players including some personal issues i have with bluehole and their decisions surrounding pubg . that being said , it was fun while it lasted but like they say all things must come to an end . and if pubg has issues running on an xb <num> x , which has <num> gb gddr <num> memory and a faster cpugpu , then i hope sony fans dont get their hopes up . lol ! the ps <num> pro runs on <num> gb gddr <num> memory with a slower and less powerful cpugpu , so for those whose thinking its going to run better . its not ! the standard ps <num> will run the same as the xb <num> s , with all of the same exact problems . however , i was really hoping that bluehole and microsoft was going to stick together , but my hopes for pubg remaining an xbox exclusive for consoles , was a let down and a huge disappointment for me ! i hope microsoft releases a br xbox exclusive . <emoji>
__label__helpful the game would rival pubg as a free game but laggy controlls . the v buck cost way to much some guns are useless or sometimes for example riffles way to op . the graphics are aa grade for a free game and the custom building is nice ! i do not like battle royale though maybe add in like a <num> v <num> tdm or <num> v <num> war mode . the game is really just a battle royale and it has no incentive to win . so stars its <num> until thats fixed or i will check out the pve when it is free then maybe it will deserve a <num> or <num> star . i really wanted to give this a bad review but i have hope for this game it has constent updates . good luck <emoji>
__label__helpful addicted fun to play i cant craft some items and i need them really wish i knew how to fix it
__label__unhelpful dis game gave me de diabetes ! i dont like dat ! it has des trash skins and dey like be costing like <num> dollar ! i could get ur mum for an hour for dat ! anyway ! i hope u lik mah knowledge ! ill be dabing on ze haters . <emoji> i have one of those . litboi
__label__helpful buying any version of this does not at this time mean you will be able to play . many who have bought physical and digital copies are locked out of their accounts and are told to rebuy what they have already purchased . codes that are included in physical copies are not properly redeeming . myself aswell as many others havnt been able to play for <num> days . buyers beware ! i would post this review on the version i purchased but it doesnt reconize that i own it . game support takes <num> hrs to respond and has been no help .
__label__unhelpful great shooting , i love unlimited sprint , cool crafting mechanics , single ques , duos , and team ques , although . some lagfps hiccups & some minor bugs . imo this is the best battle royale on consoles rn . <emoji>
__label__helpful so far ive played <num> games and got far no crashes yes the graphics tend to take its time to load but its fine
__label__unhelpful save your money this game very porly done , hit boxs are out of this world some guns are way better than the other , save your self the rage and stay away from this game , theres also little money grabers if you wanna look cool , like wouldnt you just love to look like a clown or maybe a bright yellow bannana ? well they cost abot <num> bucks , you cant say im only writing this cuz im bad well im platinum so , and dont get me starded on the jerks who play this game
__label__unhelpful this the greatest game to come out since tic tac toe ! if you like to spray and pray , snick and snack , and chew some gosh darn good bubblegum , this is the game for you ! pros : shoot like a pro gangsta saving damsel in distress fight tooth and nail for victory shoot through stuff shoot your teammate the graphics are beyond this world , makes my fatback telly like a hd hidef tellyvision . it just blew my mind . cons : you cant use a wounded enemy as a meat shield . you cannot hide in closets no weapon pickups no arresting the bad guys no arresting teammates no handheld taser cannot remove clothing conclusion : i can play this game for eons , this game is some soul shattering stuff , siege will take you on a feels rollocoasta . making you question everything . like is that teammate going to shoot me ? hes aiming right at my face . this game will teach you about life ! like how wood is bulletproof or how falling <num> feet can incarcerate you game set match dope ! yeaaaah dooooug
__label__unhelpful everything about this game sucks
__label__helpful with the new update a lot of bugs have been fixed making the game run faster , and better overall .
__label__helpful this is a great semi tactical fps , but most of the players are there to ruin the game , not play along . and im not talking about good players who are undefeatable . trolls , team killers , people kicking you for one or no errors , offensive language , and so on . just general greif , and the worst part is ubisoft hasnt done to much to fix it , in fact they probably embrace it . ive played tons of online fpss and ive havent seen grief this bad and consistent in a long time . it makes online border line unplayable , pvp or co op pve . but if you find saints among sinners , this game can be very fun and enjoyable . i sadly have little hope for the online community so i miss out on a lot of stuff , cause i typically play solo .
__label__helpful love the game but i please make maps a craftable item ! i was so bummed after working hard to get all the necessary materials that its not something you can make in this version . exploring would be a lot more fun if i didnt have to worry about getting lost , even if i do now have a compass . otherwise i do enjoy it a lot . being able to jump between tablet mode and pc is really great .
__label__unhelpful i won a game and wasnt awarded the <num> bp it said i earned . until this inequality is justified , this game will retain a <num> star rating . compensation must be awarded . update : i just won yet another game and was still not awarded the bp i earned . you now owe me <num> bp player unknown .
__label__helpful this is a really awesome game . the gameplay is super fun and rewarding and each match is different so the game never feels repetitive . one of the best parts about the game is that every few months the developers release new content for free ! that is what makes me come back to this game time and time again , because the developers actually care about it and arent just trying to make a quick buck . sure , there are bugs every now and then but they are usually minor and are fixed quickly in an update . i cant recommend this game more , its great to play by yourself and with friends . its just a great game .
__label__unhelpful i stopped playing mionecraft but wanna refund my dlcs ecause i cant install them on my nbew pc
__label__helpful wait for something better to come out .
__label__helpful the poor reviews are uncalled for . clearly , there are features missing and some problems . overall , very impressed thus far . positive : very smooth scrolling , clean textures , distance viewing goes for miles without killing your system , and most of all . the tie into your live account is fantastic . very easy dl and account mgt . friends connectivity through live is also fantastic . great start ! needs improvement : absolutely need dedicated server and more stable multiplay . it does tend to crash or lag at times for those connecting . (just <num> intranet struggled at times) mc is supposed to be a realtime world . you cant just shutdown and nothing happens . i want to come back and see my wheat grown and my town nuked by creepers . i do eventually want to see pluginmod capability . these are the lifeblood of mc and keep the interest level up .
__label__helpful fortnite used to be a fun but challenging game , now its full of too many guns , too many gimmicks , and full of people in the fanbase that want things that will make the game even more luck based than it already is . its should be pretty easy to fix your game epic .
__label__unhelpful i like the game but it really needs the built in crafting guide while you craft instead of making you know all the steps yourself .
__label__helpful as a new player to battle royale games i can say pubg is a experience on xbox one . bad graphics with poor loading of textures and very short draw distance . no tutorial or bot mode to learn how to play . try to figure out the controls during a match and get instantly killed . its not fun . it feels a low budget indie game that is years away from being a full game . dont waste your time or money .
__label__unhelpful bait n switch with paid loot . early access is new marketing speak for paying to beta test . wait for the actual release and save your money . never again , epic . <emoji> holy crap what happened to the tower defense we paid for ?
__label__helpful had this happens while playing missions . white delivering the bomb . and you cant actually find objectives because there not on the map . we literally destroyed everything on the map . and then the game removed us . because we ran out of time . because the objective where nowhere to be found .
__label__unhelpful my cloud saves will not work . i have multiple computers and devices . so if i want to play minecraft but i cant because my worlds wont sync . so microsoft if you want to say this have cloud saves then make it have cloud saves im aj brewer and i , and i ! do not approve false advertising . ps its a pain in the but to transfer them over to other devices
__label__unhelpful in an attempt to stop fortnite from conquering the console they threw this garbage into the ring to fight and its getting destroyed . this console port is horrid and a shameful example of corporate greed .
__label__helpful the longer you play , the more the game introduces making it harder and more complicated . ive played the game for the better part of today ( <num> ) and i will say that so far i have been enjoying it thoroughly , even being stuck playing with random strangers and no communication . its easy enough that you dont necessarily need communication although believe me it helps . the further you progress the more types of baddies the game introduces , and the harder and stronger they become . the skill tree becomes increasingly larger and slightly more confusing the more you level up , and i will say the thing i have been annoyed with the most is the lack of clear description or explanation for a lot of game mechanics , specifically having to do with survivors , squads and other such things you deal with in the menus . but , to be fair , some things ive given up in confusion on get explained just a few story missions later . has a great feature that allows to rejoin ongoing game if your game crashes .
__label__unhelpful its a good game but they have a lot of fixing to do . a shot gun to the face up close should be a instant kill not <num> damage especially if they have <num> sheld and heath . you have to shoot somebody in the head <num> times with a shotgun if they have <num> sheld and health witch is completely retar if your lucky its <num> shots and there dead other wise if they kill you and you see there heath most likey they have <num> health or lower . i dont know about you but when you shoot somebody in the head it should be an instant kill not <num> shots to the head with a shotgun later .
__label__unhelpful if you like awful games that feel like they were made in the <num> s you might like it <emoji>
__label__unhelpful the crafting part of the game is ridiculous and is not needed and the game looks like a cartoon ! you shoot someone and all of a sudden thier building a huge and tall fort ! i dont get it !
__label__helpful rendering , video boundry , connection team mate , all new issues . but hey , got new flowers and ac unit in windows . just another garbage game now .
__label__helpful i thank you mojang for creating minecraft
__label__unhelpful this game is trash , get pubg instead .
__label__helpful i dont enjoy the fact all the people who paid for the founders pack got kicked asside by stupid free battle royal . i feel betrayed , and i will no longer be purchasing or supporting content from epic games
__label__unhelpful boring game with severe unrealistic qualities for a game that claims tons of realism . the game has hardly any true custimization options for the charactersclasses . never actually played the pvp , but cant imagine it being very good since all the game modes are variations of cods search and destroy . i did play quiet alot of terrorist hunt and the situations ; the enemy ai goes from a god to complete retard at times , sometimes within seconds . the lack of a true story mode kills any leftover interest that i may have had . to be honest i never would have played this game if it wasnt free to play for a weekend because i had heard such bad things about it when it came out .
__label__helpful i dont like how you cant download fortnite on a computer . plz change this
__label__unhelpful this game is great , ive always enjoyed minecrafts sandbox feel , and the games performance is great on lowend hardware (and this game is on par with <num> . <num> on full pc game) but it is missing one critical thing that will kill this game if not fixed . add in support for processors with x <num> architecture . why lock it down to only processors running with x <num> bit architecture ? out of the five pcs i own , i can only run the game on two simply because of a single processor limitation . please remove this mojang , otherwise , minecraft : windows <num> edition is doomed to fail .
__label__helpful this game is extremely fun and addictive . running around and playing with friends is a big thumbs up . the game offers many languages to choose from . the number of building blocks this game has is extraordinary . aside from that , the game is constantly being updated and has almost caught up with minecraft java edition . i love this game and it is one of my favorites . i hope anyone else who plays it will love it as much as i do !
__label__unhelpful fortnite has nothing to this game !
__label__helpful i love the game so much . there are so many endless possibilities ! you can build and create in both modes(pocket edition) , survival is hard but its awesome . creative mode is a lot easier , because i have easy access to a whole lot of items and can build whatever you like !
__label__helpful i used to play the game till i realised how toxic a community of <num> year olds can be . basically voice chat is double pump ! also hes hacking ! and your trash ! and dont get me started on the streamers cough cough ninja who do stupid things like the pompom . what is a pom pom . then lastly how they ruined there game by adding things like golfcarts and grocery carts .
__label__unhelpful if my grandpa gave me <num> <emoji> then i would buy this game <num> times ! ✌✌ <emoji> legit the best shooter to ever come to the xbone juan x holy gauceeemole this game probably has the best graphics like ever created <emoji> they must have teleported to the furture and created the best game engine to ever be ran <emoji> my favorite clothing item in the game would have to be big shaqs mans not hot <emoji> jacket . ok so back on topic . my daddy loves me lots like more than your dad could ever love you because unlike your dad my dad eats <emoji> i think that if your dad loves you he would by pubg (and thats is pronounced poob <emoji> gee) oh and btw if you havent played fortnite yet dont get mad get glad because like that game is hot <emoji> garbage <emoji> this game has it all pvp⚔⚔⚔ cool cars <emoji> hot girls to flex on <emoji> and has the biggest open world you have ever seeeeeeen <emoji> well i think i might have to go soon because i only get <num> charaters and im already on <num> so goodbye
__label__unhelpful ive been dealing with lag , now the whole thing freezes after opening my game . ive not been able to play this game for months , because of the constant issues . fix it .
__label__unhelpful playing this is the same as on the ipad , but mine is messed up so using this really helps me a lot . for you people who want an update , it should come out any day now . although , since you log in with xbox accounts , it would be better if it was more similar to the xboxps <num> version .
__label__unhelpful thanks microsoft for x <num> support but it is extremely like pe and i dont want to play pe on a pc .
__label__helpful tthis game was worth the wait hell my friend got me this and game sharing wit my gf we are having a blast even if its not fully open world this a builders
__label__helpful untill its finished . otherwise youre gonna waste time and money to get raped by lag , cheaters , framerate drops , with keyboard & mouse , russians . so go tell youre favorite rich youtuber to go fuckhimself for promoting an unpolished pice of gorilla
__label__helpful poor controls and framerate make pubg challenging to play and enjoy . i want to like this game . plays like a bad fps from <num> years ago . should have been $ <num> .
__label__helpful a bunch of unsportsman like kids play this game . cant play a game without a teammate intentionally killing me to the point where im boycotting this game
__label__unhelpful i was sort of disappointed , in the pictures it showed that it looked sort of fun . villagers , creations , creepers , etc . but in the game its just sort of sad . that need to add much more things such as redstone , the end , a design other than the mcpe edition , and something that really bothered me customized controls . on regular minecraft the controls i used were much different , so when i got on and i left clicked , it deleted a block , i used it to place a block , it bothered me very much . i know this is in beta testing and it will get better but for now it just needs a lot of fixingadding
__label__unhelpful it will not install on my nextbook flexx <num> . i have upgraded to windows <num> . what do i do i am crying right now . by this i mean it says i have to use a device with more features . what does that mean ?
__label__unhelpful i am not going to talk about how the game is broken , because we all know that . but when is save the world gonna be free ? and why do outfits cost <num> to <num> dollars ? i feel like it is just because they want more money for a ripoff of pubg . fun for a while but gets boring . rpg is op . shooting through walls is a new update . <num> star
__label__unhelpful i think its overall enjoyable .
__label__helpful very easy on the go , but they should let us be able to download mods like decocraft and download texture packs like cutecraft or something like that : )
__label__helpful thank gawd microsoft added this to free play days , now i wont make the mistake of wasting money on it .
__label__helpful i love this game but i wish you didnt have to pay for it because now i played the trial and im addicted to it but i keep getting the the end of the trial and it jut a bummer to loose all the stuff i built and collected : _(
__label__helpful i really enjoy this game , but they should add more situations , players going outside is big problemo , i have no problem with the last person standing kind of simulation . i enjoy the ranked project but it has been in beta for quite a while but i understand it takes time to work on the championships . the one thing i find annoying are the teamkillers , sometime i accidental teamkill and get a <num> day or <num> min ban . also one last thing if you at all compare this game to the lastest fps games (cod and bf) you dont at all deserve this one of a kind game .
__label__helpful i like the game , very fun and relaxing .
__label__helpful most over rated game in the world !
__label__unhelpful glad to know that microsoft intentionally made it difficult for newcomers to the minecraft series to differentiate between the windows <num> edition , which is essentially the mobile version , and the real game . i bought this assuming itd be the actual game , just very optimized for windows . im very dissatisfied with my purchase and am definitely going to take considerations the next time i deal with microsoft . awful business model .
__label__unhelpful dont even bother . just go play fortnite instead . its worth more than this sorry excuse of a game .
__label__helpful i like the villages animals and blocks ! i wish that it had citys that could spawn in the worlds . but if you like building anything out of blocks than you will love minecraft .
__label__helpful i love how this game is so creative and lets the mind lose . also it is a great way to socialize with friends and to create more friends . but now when ever i try to get into the game it wont let me join . if you fix i would appritieate so much ! thx ! : ) < <num>
__label__helpful ive been playing since season one , hard to believe right ? this game made me fall in love with it but the updates ever since <num> have made the game a salty pool of luck , broken mechanics , and modesweapons that arent balanced out before release . the old players are leaving , the new ones joining for the bandwagon before quiting after a few weeks of playing . my friend got me stw and i love it so i hope that if and when br dies the devs [epic] dont do what theyre doing to br nowadays . epic , if you see this andor it makes it your way , please stop , look at what br used to be and try to bring back the things old players enjoyed . p . s the weekly updates seemed great when they started in december but , they have to stop or at the least be balanced , fair , mostly working (because ya bad things , glitches , and exploits occur) , and skill based maybe even role based . sincerly , a season one veteran default
__label__helpful its a great game where you can build beyond your imagination and i love how you can do basically anything and use it for youtube and make a living off of having fun !
__label__helpful all it does is show me the title screen background . please help !
__label__unhelpful i want my money back please . nowhere near as smooth as fortnite . very laggy and controls are horrible .
__label__helpful the game is a bunch of fun but still has the issue where it says the demo has run out even though you have paid for it . you just need to click on purchase and it will let you play again but it is annoying . update , this problem has been solved .
__label__unhelpful instead of fixing the game they added more . and their reward system is still stupid as hell , spend <num> k on crate , get a duplicate , exchange value <num> . wth
__label__helpful there is nothing to like , this game preview will hurt the potential that the xbox one x had . it features minecraft graphics with a draw distance worse than my kids art . not to mention even <num> frames per second would be a great accomplishment . this game features playdough houses , loot that you can’t pick up , and terrible response from a controller . anybody who tells you to buy it is high on hype and maybe crack at least wait till its out of preview . bluehole doesnt know how to optimize anything . i wouldn’t even steal this game from gamestop . lastly anyone who states that it’s in preview and we should expect nothing more is dead wrong , this game has ran smoothly on pc for the last couple months unless you’re still running windows <num> , we have to hold devs to higher standards . this game could be good but it’s not thats why i give it <num> thumbs down .
__label__unhelpful game is full of scrubs and <num> year olds . i wish i could have rated this game <num> stars . i played while waiting for pubg to come out and ill never go back . i hope that metor wipes out the entire game and not just tilted towers .
__label__unhelpful come on microsoft , minecraft is a great game and you turned it to crap with the windows <num> edition , its just a really crappy version of pocket edition but useable on computers , you cant even log in as yourself , and dont give me the beta crap like seriously theres already a fully released version , use it as a template instead of creating it from scratch , grow a brain and stop screwing up an amazing game
__label__helpful when i first came around to purchasing this game , i was expecting a cheaper game with the same support as javapc edition . i was also expecting the best servers for java edition such as hypixel , and i was sadly mistaken . i quickly realized that it was just a pe for the pc , which i already owned on a tablet . there were also no new original updates , and the servers were also for pe , which doesnt support the same servers as pc . basically just pe for pc . the only new thing was that you had to pay for anything additional such as skin and mashup packs , which have maps that a good building team could crush instantly . i just dont like the direction that minecraft has taken since windows took over , which i have heard others saying the same as me
__label__helpful thought i was buying done retail game , not another early access gimick . start screen saying closed beta was shocking . constant crashes & lag . super harsh durability is boring . pay to play microtransactions as usual . just wait for finished free version next year .
__label__unhelpful im tired of having to constantly uninstall and then redownload this game because of a glitch that makes me unable to do anything because it glitches out the camera to some out of bounds area and im unable to see where my character is going or what doing , i would not recommend you waste money on a game like this thats just gonna break
__label__unhelpful i like cold beverage yeah
__label__helpful the game is the fun minecraft experience weve all come to know , and is a solid first step for microsoft on this platform . however , some work definitely needs to be done with regards to the ux when playing with controller . the interface that we see on consoles would be ideal , and im confident this will be implemented , but in the meantime crafting with a controller is such a chore that i doubt ill play this version of the game very much .
__label__helpful everybody loves fighting exploring and building . i love brewing potions enchanting tools and building cities . new things are coming like red stone wiring which gives more excitement and exploration . own a house a castle a city or an empire . best played with friends .
__label__helpful it is nice , but we should not have to pay for gold to play this game .
__label__helpful waited <num> min in queue just so it could fail on me over & over not bad enough there are many ppl having to wait <num> +min and still cant logg in i wish i could give this <num> stars , i regret ever having heard of this game dont believe the hype . i want my money back !
__label__unhelpful like my title , its the same version as the java version but worse and restricted with microtransactions . why would i pay for something that was free before ? make this stuff free microsoft , youre wasting time with making money instead of improving the games experience .
__label__unhelpful i absolutely loved minecraft <num> . <num> . <num> on my mac but i cant play my mac so i got the new version of windows <num> and found out the game was out and tested it (i absolutely love being a beta tester) and it was pretty good apart from the fact the i cant make cauldrons or enchantment tables which could be a bug or they are still working on them . i loved it . <num> ign
__label__helpful it is awesome all the way , just to do command hit t and enter killgabe or tpgabe thats the way cammands roll best game i ever played just hit that play button & you are good to go .
__label__unhelpful was bouta get a dub with my boi clerf . he disconnected for no reason , later the game building does not work at . i died . frick fortnite .
__label__helpful i was expecting this new roblox server to be uniteresting and boring like most roblox server , but this game is different ; fluid combat , tactical strategy , and new gameplay mechanics use the roblox engine to its fullest potential . therefore i give cs : go in roblox <num> stars , nice work roblox team !
__label__helpful all the rubber band lag and crashes that get you killed that you have always wanted .
__label__unhelpful minecraft windows <num> edition is worth buying but it is also not worth buying because why buy basic minecraft again . because that is what minecraft windows <num> edition is . if you want to be smart spend your money on the original minecraft . but if you would like to see where they go with this than buy it . think one way they could have improved minecraft windows <num> edition is by just taking the latest update of minecraft and started there . so in conclusion just by normal minecraft .
__label__unhelpful i like the game it is cool
__label__unhelpful i hate ths game ! dont install it ! play playerunkowns battlegrounds .
__label__unhelpful you will need a phd to navagte the controls . fix this then it will be fun
__label__helpful i love the windows <num> beta , its awesome and really fun everything is cool and i can even use my xbox <num> controller to play it . one bug that i really dont like though is that if youre walking while you open an item like a chest or something similar then you still walk .
__label__helpful realistic , fun and challenging <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i love this game <num> if you dont like it its cuz you cant aim or suck at building or your just trash ♻
__label__unhelpful dont like the dab or that fact of friendships being destroyed ? how could epic games go from gears to this trash ?
__label__unhelpful laggy mess matchmaking takes <num> minutes you load into a game that feels like its running on a cell phone should have never wasted my money its more entertaining to burn toast
__label__unhelpful this game is the cancer of the internet and will just end up like minecraft did its unfun to new players trying to play the game and other platforms have unfair advantages due to mobile haveing the option to see sound and pc has quicker aim it the most unfun game i have ever played and its just going to get worst even <num> year olds are playing the game might as well get the hole minecraft comunity over here then this game is cancer and is going to burn i can already see it now aus , fandoms , under age players every were so go ahead go play a game that you cant even play because a player is going to kill you before you even start and the game has already started to generate dank memes and and if you did win good for you your another loser without a life
__label__helpful i like this app . i only needs a little adjustment to fit the real minecraft software . plus , it works with pe servers and pe minecraft realms !
__label__helpful the game requires no skill . you literally just point at who you want to kill , and boom theyre dead . look out for those kids who spam walls everywhere because theyre too scared for a gun fight . my <num> year old cousin has won solo many times because he only knows the two buttons to win this game . the aim button , and the shoot button . atleast pubg requires skill and patience . its fair in every gun fight and people actually have to fight for their lives . this game ? no . you just have to tear down a bunch of houses and get a scar and boom instant win . leave this game for little kids , shoukd really put a maximum age limit of <num> on the game .
__label__helpful this game got me addicted to minecraft and the sountrack . oh the sountrack . it makes me want to just float into that world . loved every minute of it .
__label__helpful r <num> is a great but if anyone is experiencing a bug where your dlc operators are gone , just delete everything (besides saved data) . reinstall everything when you go back to your game and you should have all of operators back . also , team killing isnt that much of an issue (in the amount of time ihave played , im lvl <num> on xbone an lvl <num> on ps <num> )
__label__helpful this is the fifth time writing this so its going to be breif . now this isnt written to hate on the game this is actually one of my favorite games im writing this in hope epic games will see it . the grid system is really messed up if im trying to build a wall i dont want it to be place in the groud or below whatever im standing on . also the lag i dont know if its the game or my internet but everyones complaining about it so i assume its the game please fix it if possible . that all the issues i have with the game . another thing please read comments not ratings when seeing if something is worth getting ive seen people ive the game a one star because there were to many tryhards its pathetic seeing how salty people have caused an amazing game to have a two star rating overall .
__label__helpful i cant get it on my xbox life on my laptop i need help
__label__helpful i have owned minecraft since it first came out on pc , i enjoyed the community and thought it was a great game . then it came out on xbox <num> . i fell in love with that version ( ya it might not have had the servers and people , but it was special and different . it gave off a lovable and enjoyable feeling . not only that but the textures were different and brighter in a good way) . i believe that mojang has brought that experience back with minecraft : windows <num> edition . the game is stunning and makes me remember the first time i have ever played minecraft . this game can not even be described by words , so i say that if you want to have fun without the problems of violence and rudeness then you would love this game
__label__helpful bluewhale entertainment need to get their head out their and fix this game its absoutly terrible if they dont fix this game soon i want my money back
__label__helpful thanks to the most recent update the game has been alot better . now it lags alot less and almost no crashing , between the day it updated to the time of this review , it has only crashed once . now to have the buildings load in faster .
__label__unhelpful this game is trash i could watch old people try to suck their toes and get better gameplay than this heaping pile of trash
__label__helpful continue to play on the pc . the console version needs a lot of work . im on the xb <num> x and its buggy and choppy af . controls are confusing at first but youll get used to them . dont expect to be quick and fast like the pc version either . graphics are toned down to probably the lowest on the pc . i would wait to buy this game if i where you , wait till they patch it and it is more smooth . i love pubg but this is a terrible port and needs a lot of work . i would rate this a <num> star but i dont take <num> stars very seriously .
__label__unhelpful novel idea . frustrating game play with glitches in every aspect . time to delete again after <num> <num> <num> update .
__label__unhelpful r <num> wont update no matter anything ive done , i literally reset my console and the only solution ive found is to uninstall and reinstall which is <num> gb everytime this is the third time ive done that
__label__helpful <num> ) its a beta , it says so in the product name <num> ) yes , there are horses in game . they spawn quite often . <num> ) the title runs great on low end hardware . i am currently running it on a dell venue <num> pro <num> gb version and it does not miss a beat . also , contrary to what has been stated , you can use community texture packs as well as store bought ones . the update cycle runs along with the minecraft pocked edition versions . ive also seen mention that it was not made for pc . this version is quite easy and smooth with keyboard and mouse but does well with controller or touch if need be .
__label__helpful downloaded this onto my surface pro (i <num> gb ram <num> gb storage) and it runs like a champ ! i never had the original pc version , but i play the xbox <num> xbox one versions quite a bit . my only wish is to give us the option to use the same crafting scheme as the xbox no recipes to remember and quicker to craft items ! thanks for the xbox <num> controller support woohoo ! by the way , i bought this with xbox rewards money it was a free game for me ! woohoo !
__label__helpful its great to see bluehole , playerunknown and xbox working together to make this dream come true . yes the controls are wonky and the server has some lag but over all its a great game and i know they will make changes they need to , to get the game where we the people want it and where they want it .
__label__helpful mojang your game is the best game i have ever played and i want to tell you that your game is starting to grow a lot and i want you to improve your game .
__label__helpful good sensitivity on public test server before last update . last update made sensitivity way too slow again . making a shooter game where i cant turn fast even on highest possible sensitivity is a joke and an insult to competitive players who spent money on your game . make your settings more robust . current settings and still turning too slow : <num> general <num> <num> x <num> <num> x <num> <num> x <num> <num> x . the <num> x and <num> x need to be able to go at least to <num> maybe <num> on current increments . its actually sad that they made it better and then made it shltty again though .
__label__unhelpful i have a mouse and keyboard , i want to be able to use it naturally with the controls i like , but they only have <num> qwerty layouts . its unplayable this way . do i have a controller , sure but its unplayable with a controller after having played it prems with a mouse and keyboard . controllers are good for some things , racing games , platformers , but not for first person adventureshooter . the controls are clumsy and imprecise . i will not play the ms version of this game till they fix at least the keyboard and mouse controls . i suspect there are quite a few other major annoyances that dont exist in the java client as well but i wont find them till they fix the biggest issue .
__label__helpful honestly , one of the best fps games to come out in a long time . it requires teamwork and precision , and it is hard on new comers . give it time , learn the game and i promise you it is well worth the money .
__label__helpful i <num> st played this game in september and this game was amazing it had no toxic <num> year olds , they listened to the fans , ect . until season <num> when they blow up to <num> million players they got so money hungry and greedy they stoped listening to the og season <num> player and only listened to the noobs of season <num> and <num> . they did awful changes like the removal of the old song that people enjoyed , added useless weapons like the stink bomb , port o fort ect , made the game isolated by the stupidity added smg meta and disappearing skill gap , and worst of all they even added a <num> increased bloom count to make the game more noob friendly ! but still people spend stupid amounts of money on the galaxy skin , battle pass ect . the game is still the most viewed game on youtube and twitch even though they lost <num> + million players after july . its got sooo cancerous that ail a and fortnite clickbait are everywhere that i cant even watch a single video without fortnite . so in my opinion fortnite will die
__label__helpful this game is all about teamwork . get five people with mics in a squad and its stupid fun . hit detection is trash . ubisoft servers are trash . game gets infuriating at times , especially when nobody works together . other than that its wildly addicting , and an amazing concept that makes the game worth it , despite ubisofts terrible execution .
__label__helpful this game is trash and boring . all luck based as well .
__label__helpful not bad . pretty good and crashes not so often but when it crashes its baad because . say its a <num> v <num> and your about to kill him and then your game crashes r . i . p . also i lost from network lag detected thx pubg i know your game is still in early access but it triggers me sometimes
__label__helpful i like everything just need more vehicles .
__label__helpful this is fun but expensive they should drop the price to half of what it is now .
__label__helpful course the game is still not done . its a game preview . its going to have lots of bugs . we are testers . its just gonna get better by time . give it a chance . i play on the pc but playing on the xbox is a different game style and im loving it . different ways to play the game on both . youre going to have to put in a lot of time to learn the map and the game style compared to cod , battlefield , and any other soldier games your play before . its a must to play with voice chat n super fun with friends . no spawn killing start the game and survive . winning is gonna be tough but the most satisfied win when you do . its a must to have a good headset , so you could pay attention to your surroundings . this game is going to get better in time . if youre up for the challenge . this game is just the beginning of being something great ! you will regret it , for not buying it early and learning this type of game style . check out videos on youtube , if that doesnt change your mind . dont buy it . wwcd !
__label__unhelpful building is awesome gets updated frequently and new weapons every few weeks and amazing skins save the world is my vbucks giver takes time and practice to get skilled at the game and map gets updated not like pubg with no campain and like other shooters not like fortnite most played game i played and if you think overwatch is fun muselk played it and is playing fortnite pubg no good skins if you think mouse is best with speed you can change sensitivity .
__label__unhelpful the best battle royale game ever pubg sucks and fortnite rules <emoji>
__label__unhelpful . still has a very long way to go but i have only crashed once since yesterday and i feel like that is a good way to progress the games development . also the new setting help alot . maybe the next update could better optimize the game . i think that would be a great next update . this is not my final review .
__label__helpful all people do is camp behind trees or build a tower to hide in . what is the fun in that . imo its pretty much like call of duty but with building towers and more players in the match .
__label__unhelpful its <num> : <num> am and istill cant access the game . im still hyped though .
__label__helpful charging me to play after i paid to play is the reason why this game will be dead next year .
__label__helpful could not find a single thing i liked about it . could not figure out how to get full screen . always had the taskbar at the bottom and the window bar at the top . then , controls could not be altered . i use the mouse left handed and controls right handed , so this was extremely awkward for me . once there is the option to set up my own controls , i might give it another try . if you own the android version already , youre not missing anything here . for now though , ill pass .
__label__unhelpful bad . this game visual effects crash on a perfectly capable pc , and i can change all the video settings that i want , but the screen play freezes while the actual game play continues . i really really hope that an update is released to fix this problem , because it is a large inconvenience . the rest of the game is superb otherwise .
__label__helpful when i first started playing i knew it was going to be a great game and it was and was playing at the time around season <num> and it is still a great game .
__label__unhelpful why does game start at hold at mojang then close by itself with no errors . this is ridiculous that i have to waste a week trying to figure this out . if it was a apple product i would be able to find support within seconds but i have been shipped all around the world with no support . it cant be this complicated to fix a app issue . we have a windows <num> with up to date software . it was working and now it stopped , looks like others have similar issues with no resolution .
__label__unhelpful but i cant seem to figure out how this is supposed to be fun .
__label__unhelpful really good game thats challenging and great for passing time
__label__helpful i have played minecraft since it first came out . minecraft was the first ever video game i played and i am still in love with the game to this day . i highly recommend this game to anyone . i really helps me with my eye coordination . the only thing is i wish they would add commands to this version .
__label__unhelpful for all the people who say this games frames are trash idk what year your in but it runs fine on a s so stop . gunplay is more fair then fa i mean fortnite . graphics are fine we dont need <num> fps all the time . map is better more varity . luck is half the game so thats why its fun not every bloody game you have a chance of winning . goodbye fas
__label__unhelpful its obvious that microsoft plans to microtransaction the game . drop it now , and keep to the java version .
__label__helpful this game would be amazing if the hitboxes werent broken , ranked still isnt complete after <num> years , and theres alot glitches . the gameplay makes up for it though . with just a little bit more work this game would be perfect .
__label__unhelpful pendapat saya mengenai minecraft windows <num> edition ini merupakan versi paling sempurna karena kinerja yang baik ketika dijalankan pada perangkat computer dengan spek yang kecil . minecraft windows <num> edition ini sangat cocok untuk kamu yang ingin bermain minecraft dengan tampilan yang halus , ringan , dan grafik yang lebih bagus jika dibandingkan dengan versi lainnya .
__label__helpful my minecraft windows <num> wont load its been like this for a few weeks now but i would like to tell you why <num> starts thats because it hasnt been loading and if i uninstall it ill have to at again right but if i dont then ill uninstall and re install if you could please respond to this asap great game very active and fun i play it every day when i can but today it did work ( <num> )(~kittygamer <num> xx
__label__helpful the game looks like im playing in pe , like to make a game cross play you dont need to change the look of it for all platforms . the servers are very laggy and unstable . and the pvp in the servers isnt fair ! i play on pc and its very easy to win pvp . please make the game look good depending on the device .
__label__unhelpful this game is great for the most part . there are some bugs that can be annoying , and occasionally crashes , but it is a great game .
__label__helpful the game has great potential but it needs lots of bugs fixed and less lag
__label__helpful i wouldnt mind having to download more if it helps constant crash issues
__label__helpful i got this by downloading java edition and boy its worth every penny ! p . s download java edition is minecraft . com
__label__helpful needs more tracks and some dogs to chase you though . maybe some different shoe types for the cross country parts . probably should get rid of the people shooting at you though , that isnt that realistic and it detracts from the running zen .
__label__unhelpful it isnt any different from the current minecraft , graphically . features ? well , if you play minecraft religiously on pc then i would stay away . coming from a mobileconsole platform ? then i would suggest playing it . but i played it once , for five minutes and could not get my mind off : why would microsoft pour money into this ? because it is absolutely pointless . they spent money on making a port of a console game that was already on pc for pc . good job , microsoft . you never cease to amaze me . (windows <num> is good though)
__label__helpful the colors and graphics and windows <num> are definitely superior , but since its set up like pocket edition , there are a lot of things you cant do which you can do in the old minecraft . this version definitely has potential , but to really be successful it needs to be able to do at least everything the old one could .
__label__unhelpful a : why was the information provided by f <num> removed ? id like to be able to see my coordinates sometimes . b : all the menus are crap . like seriously why do they look like the ones in the mobile version ! c : i assume this version was built on directx . give us more control over the graphics settings ! d : even with the graphics maxed out i can see popin when flying ! i thought we where on pcs so why such a limited draw distance for things like grass and flower blocks ? also why does the lod drop off so fast . e : i couldnt find a full screen button . can it go full screen ? if not , why ? f : why no commands ? how am i supposed to tp to other players in creative mode ?
__label__helpful it crashes more then i would like a $ <num> dollar game to do . fingers crossed for solid updates often . update : <num> straight games of <num> minutes playing each or more , <num> straight game crashes .
__label__helpful ubisoft , this game is great and i highly recommend it to anyone looking to pick up a fps . its very fast paced with a lot of destruction to back that up . one thing though . on pc you can lean from the hip and on console you cant . and i know some peopleare think why would you make a paragraph long review about that ? but if your a experienced player in this game , you would know how important that is . in a game where a second could spell out wi or lose , thats kinda a big deal . anyway , thank you for taking the time to read this review . i really hope ubisoft comes to realize how important this is and imputs it into consoles and not just pc !
__label__helpful it has improved tremendously ! is it perfect or done ? no , sanhoks great , graphics still need enhanced , lobby bugs wth disconnects , and frames and rendering still need improved but over all alot smoother
__label__unhelpful i did all this work just to get the game to see why my friends like it so much but i cant even access it on my laptop ridiculous
__label__unhelpful walk around a map for <num> minutes , only to have the strom or someone camping in a corner kill you , gameplay wise the aiming is awful , guns are inaccurate , loot system is completely messed . i do not understand why this game is popular
__label__helpful very low frame rates right now even on xbox one x . controls are awkward with slow responsiveness . inventory management is not at all designed for a console controller . poor audio cues for player positioning . frequent lag spikes during heavy battles . honestly , its not worth a paid early access in its current state . wait a month or two for it to get some desperately needed console polish .
__label__helpful while the speed and boats saw improvements , the gui and item selections saw downgrades . the gui is harder to navigate due to is layout and functionality is based more for a tablet than a win <num> pc . the graphics are a bit smoother , the game renders a little faster , and boats are actually usable (they were tricky to operate in the pc version) . one thing i miss is the variety of blocks and the ability to add mods that were in the pc version . it would also be nice to import my favorite minecraft pc world in to the win <num> ed . i also think having a variety of locked skins that cost $ . <num> each to unlock is a little tacky . i have it installed , and i wont uninstall it , but i probably will wait for it to improve dramatically before picking it up again . in all fairness , if i had a win <num> tablet , and was sitting in a waiting room somewhere this would probably be a good distraction . since i have a pc that is relatively powerful however , this edition seems like a step backward .
__label__unhelpful kid cartoon trash . the boogie bomb need i say more . i play big boy games with my big boy pants on . if you think your good at pvp because of this game thats really sad .
__label__helpful i like it all around it reminds me of counter strike but on roids <emoji> in my opinion there should be an option to get into games wo friendly fire or w friendly fire . dont really like the vets that play this game because when they see other players that are terrible at this game theyll get players to vote kick them or just bullies them like killing you so youd sit out a round <emoji> if anything people should help inexperienced players because how else are new players are suppose to learn ? and if people are experiencing that situation , like myself before when i was a beginner , that would really make me dislike the game .
__label__helpful i love this game soooo much ! i love the llama update ! and everything about it !
__label__helpful playerunknowns is an fun and addicting game to say the least . i have put in over <num> hours on pc and xbox put together and can say without a doubt it is worth the <num> $ price tag . the good pubg is a great game to play solo , or with friends providing amazing replay value . the skill ceiling is nearly limitless always allowing for the player to improve and polish their skills . the slow paced , strategic gameplay allows for players to play the way they want whether it be passive or hyper aggressive . personally i love that each game can play out so much differently than the last allowing for unique experiences every time . the bad <num> fps , small bugsglitches , aiming will require hours of game play to adjust to if you are used to games with aim assist (cod , halo , overwatch) . the slow roll out of pc updates to xbox , and (in my opinion) the biggest drawback is no crossplay . overall i love the game and have supported since alpha i look forward to everything they have in store !
__label__helpful teamkilled first couple games , but after one great match with three strangers i was hooked . for a free game i say <num> but for the original $ <num> i say <num> . alot of potential here . i have high hopes that theyll make this game beautiful with time ( & money) .
__label__helpful honestly , ive been playing minecraft before it was even popular . ive always loved it , and with this version , i love it too , its amazing , and features such as realms and connecting to mobile devices make it all the better . addons make it better , and i recommend using them . how ever i do feel like this and the mobile version are lacking a bit behind , i think you need to catch up on other things like stuff on the pc . overall i give it a <num> . <num> because it needs more updating .
__label__helpful odličan port minecrafta za windows <num> . to je ustvari mcpe (pocket edition) i zato možete igrati sa nekim ko koristi android ili ios , a uskoro i xbox one , ps <num> i nintendo switch sa novim crossplay updateom . još uvijek nema baš sve funkcije i blockove kao java verzija zato što je igra još uvijek u beta fazi razvoja , ali će ubrzo imati sve kao java verzija . minecraft store je također jako zanimljiva ekskluzivna funkcija ove verzije (zajedno sa mcpe) i to je jako dobar način za ulaganje u minecraft community i način za ljude koji prave mape , teksture , skinove itd . da zarade novac za svoj rad i trud što im omogućava da prave još više sadržaja . besplatan kod uz java verziju je jako dobrodušno od microsofta i dobar je način za promociju ove verzije igre . kao i svaka igra , i ova ima bugova , ali developeri su jako brzi i izbacuju česte updatee . sve u svemu ovo je jako zabavna igra koja će vam pružiti jako mnogo zabave i zadovoljstva i to je razlog što sam je ocijenio sa <num> zvjezdica ! : d
__label__unhelpful this game has got worse and worse throughout the months ive played it . i suck at this game but i usually am the only player doing anything in gold ranks . the team balancing is so bad that half of the games i play by myself or with a friend we have to carry people to the point whee by round two i will have <num> kills and every body in my squad has <num> or less kills . so many broken thing like glaz or getting kicked from a ranked game even though you your ping is under <num> . this game isnt bad but bad development choices and random buffing to operates who dont need it or just glitchs that should be fixed . it is an ok game if you have <num> man squad and luck on you side . it can acctually be fun then . p . s(you should be able to kick people from ranked if they have <num> + damage to the team , and make it two rounds pass and someone leaves replace them with a different player , but make it balanced and if losing stat loss prevention)
__label__helpful this game is a peice of crap , save your money
__label__helpful still a fun game , you get little in reward for your efforts , getting better version of playable characters (leveling up a uncommon will never beat a epic , etc) or the character themselves are very rare that you might easily drop <num> to get it or you might not . dupes are common do have a purpose though . the roll packs are very little reward for the most part i suggest waiting till its free . lots of crashing as well
__label__helpful out of <num> games , some bug limits gameplay (invisible guns , not able to pick anything up , some areas not even allowing me in , etc) in <num> of them . the other one booted me off for no reason at all . edit : the game is somewhat fixed , but still trash . every game in every region is so boring because everyone lands at tryhard towers . even ones you do meet desperately build at any range , thinking they look good when in reality they cant get a single kill . weapon balancing , you kidding me ? a full clip of a blue pistol wont kill , but one shot of a gray tac does . one last : items . $ <num> for a cosmetic skin ? thats robbery . overrated garbage , pass on this one
__label__helpful it allows me to explore and i use it for my passion of building and recreating things
__label__unhelpful it wont load like when i open minecraft it crashes at the loading screen were it says minecraft plz help me because i love this game
__label__helpful good game to play smash or pass <emoji> (german babes) <emoji> warning servers may crap all over you ! proceed with caution ! butt remember the babes .
__label__helpful frequent crashes gives a sense of pride and accomplishment . rubber banding allows me to outplay all opponents . the graphics give me nostalgia of when i was a kid playing my ps <num> . the best part is parachuting i love seeing the buildings it reminds me of water painting . the one thing i would like to see added in is a starcard system like starwars it would be fantastic new gameplay features that everyone would like . now i know what you are thinking why did i give it a one star well thats because this game is the only star in my heart .
__label__helpful terrible . not fun a laggy mess ! no fun shotguns nerfed too much ; zero damage pointblank ranged ; just not fun no more games ruined season <num> . c <num> too op ! fix or i quit
__label__unhelpful the only complaint is that it lags quite a bit .
__label__unhelpful the only reason why people like this game is because of the hype . do not buy this game . textures take about <num> minutes to load in , servers are not good , and framerate is about <num> fps . do not buy !
__label__helpful i like this game or version of this minecraft because the version is so friendly .
__label__helpful have always loved playing minecraft , love being able to play on my laptop . hoping some more updates are in the future and that the cost can be lowered for others to enjoy !
__label__helpful super enjoyable , fun to play , and very creative
__label__helpful ela was born on a farm . she knows how to raise a cock .
__label__helpful this is an awesome game . ive been having some crashes at startup , but it is easily fixed by hitting the minimize button before the mojang logo disappears .
__label__unhelpful here ya go ! before my rant , i really love this game ! i hear on mixer all the time it is a workinprogress sort of game(preview) . its been out <num> months . so , between the rubber banding , xbox locking up , pixelating , and the endless time wasted getting back in a game to find out you have been snuffed out . so much needs to be done . it is online play only(no campaign) you do have option to single , duo , or squad play . it does have a big map and what i hear , after fully complete there will be <num> . so , lots of learning . oh , this preview does not come with a manual . more fun to learn that way . all in all , hopefully this game gets fixed in the near decade before pubg <num> comes out . until then , have fun gamers !
__label__unhelpful this is worse than infinite warfare do i have to say more !
__label__helpful go into this with a friend or two . when school gets out , kids will teamkill , or boot you if you dont pull their weight . as for gadgets , pretty good . weapons get a solid d . point blank <num> . <num> rounds dont kill ? shoot a watermelon with a <num> . <num> and record the result , ubisoft ! thus indicating programmers have never been in a shootout , or research from a desk and youtube for ideas . im a gun collector , and these guns do not handle like the real thing . no slugs for shotguns ? but they put skins in for dlc , some look like a crayon . no sense of stealth , you can hear you enemies too well through massive headgear and cement buildings . hit detection buggy , and shotguns only wound point blank shot patterns dissipate after <num> yards . real shot patterns will go a football field . ranked lobbys feels like babysitting , prepare to be paired with annoying <num> year olds . <num> stars , save your money .
__label__helpful ive played r <num> s on and off for awhile . the game has interesting maps , operators , and unlockables . a lot of things are very expensive and focused a bit more towards paying actual money for it . which im not much of a fan of . i enjoy the destruction of maps with a tactical take on everything . however none of this really matters in the end . when a game is focused around multiplayer , it is the community that really determines if the game is fun or not . first two matches today . first round , before i could move i get team killed . second round , i get team killed preparing the position . third round , tkd by same guy who then gets kickedleaves . voting to kick them , instead <num> people vote to kick me . completely new match . i havent even moved yet , and because im simply talking i already have <num> people voting to kick me . all i said lets do this . the community makes this game far from enjoyable . unless you play with friends , half the time youre getting tkd no matter your skill lvl .
__label__helpful just so you know , the shotguns need to be nerfed . this game ruined <num> friendships .
__label__helpful therfore this game should be available on the xbox one as well .
__label__unhelpful to what used to be a good game . cant play new map , bugs out everytime .
__label__unhelpful edit : harry <num> x <num> & its other bf supreme gmb got triggered by my comment lmfao dude <emoji> proves my point all the more that this game just another pos that will be dead soon cause they over hype the crap out of it . its just a quick buck for em . like overwatch . one thing dose alright everyones gotta make their ow n verson . pretty much like that can i copy your homework meme fortnite : can i copy your homework ? h <num> z <num> , pubg , ect . yeah , just change it so it doesnt look like you copied . free & still dead meme
__label__helpful my issues here really arent much with the game itself . game has a cool visual style to it , im a big fan of the ability to just build fortifications when , where , and how you want . some mechanics take a little getting used to , but not the worst learning curve ive encountered . no , my issues begin and end with the fact that they are selling a closed beta to a free to play game for $ <num> . basically what they are selling you is $ <num> worth of ingame purchases , and you are paying them to beta test their game for them . its a kickstarter campaign marketed as a full game . this brings me to what really bothers me , and it is that in none of their marketing did they make clear that this is only a beta , nor were they upfront about this being destined for freetoplay status . even on this page that fact is barley a footnote . i would probably feel different if they had been more transparent about what this really is , or they didnt charge a full $ <num> . again , not a horrible game , but not worth the fee .
__label__unhelpful terrible lag and gun damage
__label__helpful xbox setting> preference> recording & capture off . i turned off more , but that runs in the back to capture screens n record vids . if you would rather have performance than proof of your chicken dinner , there ya go . update : for x , disable game <num> k and set to <num> . with it running at <num> and capture disabled the game runs great !
__label__unhelpful fortnite used to be a good game . ever since fortnite blew up , epic got so greedy and started to focus on money and cosmetics over players . they stopped caring about the players a long time ago . and yet people still play it <num> . and the whole lucktowin factor is just to get more appeal from trash players so that theyll play and buy items . fortnite is just a moneygrab now .
__label__unhelpful im sick of this where everytime i land somewhere i get killed because of lag , its not ok , and i dont know how you guys do it , but every season is worse than the last one
__label__helpful the game is fun , the maps are beautifully designed and the gameplay itself is hard but enjoyable . the problem is the multiplayer matchmaking , it takes far to long to get into a match on average it takes <num> minutes . so while it is a great competitive shooter the matchmaking just cripples it .
__label__helpful i have been playing for about a week now and im loving it , framrate can be a bit unstable , the game has froze on me quite a few times , that being said it is still a work in progress . the fact that you are getting the game for half of what they will be charging for it once it is finished is reason enough to buy it . basically your getting a half finished game for half off .
__label__unhelpful this game has a life season , s <num> defaults , s <num> tryhards and defaults , s <num> defaults half tryhards end season , s <num> tryhards , s <num> tryhards and meta guns , s <num> ? in reality i just hope this game never exists and go normally life with other game now nobody touch or play other games and i hope s <num> is the last season ? cause this game cant live longer and thx for making and showing how this game grow from nobody knew to most popular game thank you epic . realbuckedcave <num>
__label__unhelpful well , it got great but since they decided to go <num> fps , its back to lagging . not to mention they expect you to play as good as a pc player with new cross platform play . try killing a pc player with the hardcore lag xbox . just ruined the game . now its not letting me enter the game . pubg is a better , i recommend it over this .
__label__unhelpful i got this game by a code when i got the java version now i cant download the full game anymore . i am using the same email i used to use the code as well . i just bought minecraft again doesnt matter anymore
__label__helpful good . xbox login doesnt appear to be working properly . other than that though , works kind of smoothly(froze on multiplayer(from my wifi) while pvping) . hope you guys can fix the xbox login glitch .
__label__unhelpful i always get double triple quad or quint
__label__unhelpful this game is so addicted , great time killer , and the main thing is why this game need to buy when the youtuber or other website know how to download with no permission and no need to buy if this game no need to buy and install im sure a lot of people gonna like this and if you want a money you can make in by buying in the pack , skin and texture right !
__label__helpful ive been a fan of minecraft since i was <num> and i never got to play the pc version ! its like whatever is in my mind in a game ! i can build anything , i can play survival and fight monsters , or play creative and build statues ! this game is perfect for me , i love it : d
__label__helpful anywhere you go theres campers
__label__helpful this game is like a drug ; it is fun . the multiplayer is fun and i rarely find toxic players . the game feels balanced and destructability gives the gamer the option to be creative . there are also more than <num> + operators so the game never feels the same . it also encourages communication as some situations require you to talk to teammates . as much as i love rainbow there are a few flaws . the game is pretty difficult as a new player . ranked in this game is broken (but should be fixed soon) and the game is prone to crashes and disconnection . it is also kind of dumb that you need to buy two season passes . if ubisoft could fix this the game would be a lot better . otherwise , the game usually plays really well . if this games issues can be fixed , it would get <num> stars . i highly recommend this game to anybody looking to try a new tactical shooter .
__label__helpful the game has too many crashes and cra . almost finished with tier <num> defense . need to fix bugs with game
__label__unhelpful hyellow ! hit is yer boi , dr . russia commming at u live frum ze mudder russia isself . todaey we are gunto be dropp sum sicc nastie beets on gaem . is lot better than carpy gaem , undertail and i hate all other gaems . russia is best , we hav gud nastie beet , if u dunt leik minces raft then u succ and u shud die . gg no re . dunt u daer give bad review . get off my board ! reeeeeeeeeeee !
__label__helpful hmm , quite amazingly done , here , here . i cant wait until the crossplatform gameplay . this game has really taken me aback into the good ol days of minecraft with its simplicity and new additions . without all of that java bull , the game runs perfectly ; even on a system with <num> installed ram . thankee for that ! i also cant wait for online multiplayer and xbox live additions , skins and so on . i also wouldnt mind small patches and stuff for the little things ; adding a busted up pick axe with a new one and theyll become one and such . well , i think thats all for me . hey , cheers ! to the best minecraft beta the world has ever seen . if youre a fan of the indiehit , minecraft , and can deal with the lack of overwhelming content this is the game for you . long days and pleasant nights , sai .
__label__helpful once you start , it wont be easy to quit . this is an improving port of the pocket edition . worlds load almost instantly ! controller support builtin ! classic crafting only (so far) . infinite worlds and many more features on the way . one drawback is the addition of microtransactions such as buying skins , although for now , it supports getting your own custom skins . hint needs cloud saving for worlds , hint
__label__unhelpful i can play with my kids on their non windows tablets , please keep it that way ! (until windows store gets basic games they will always have those)
__label__unhelpful before you mark this unhelpful , let me explain . this is the most laggy game i have ever played , the lag is worse than cod running off of mcdonalds wifi , also you could find the best assualt rifle in a matter of minutes or it could take you ten minutes to just to find a pistol , my point is , this game has way to many luck factors in it . and please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions . if you fixed the game like this , i would give the game four out of five stars . update , jan <num> , still garbage , the game has gotten much worse , the silenced pistol is way overpowered , you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone . also , shotguns are still overpowered lower their damage . i tryed pubg and at least that game has balanced health and weapon damage plus there are no shield potions to be found in pubg update jan <num> lag is fixed so heres <num> stars shotguns are still way overpowered , i have no more room left so <emoji>
__label__helpful if you see this rating and you dont have the game , buy it !
__label__helpful this is a brilliant first step in the future of minecraft . with the feedback system in place , this is sure to be a success , just like windows <num> . what it needs is a continuum feature like windows <num> also that adapts the ui to be more touch friendly for tabletsphones and then be more keyboard and mouse friendly for laptopsdesktops . if mod support and textureresource packs and almost all java features can be implemented then this is surely going to be one of the most successful games ever . (feedback : although xbox live integration is great and i love getting achievements in the action centre i do think offline access should be allowed as xbox live takes ages to actually log in when all you want to do is play ! xbox live is also blocked in school networks so kids cant play during lunchtime which isnt good . ) it does turn the fan on in my surface pro <num> which i was hoping this version wouldnt : (
__label__helpful i recommend this version to anyone who has ever played minecraft before . i got this free from my minecraft <num> gb xbox one s and i got to say , its actually a lot better than the original one . if you are a parent reading this , you need to buy this game for your kids . minecraft is all about creativity . back in <num> , people would just build bases to survive nights today , it is different ! imagine what ever you want , and minecraft has all the materials . minecraft has changed over the years , but this is the one to go with ! : d
__label__helpful just started so im trash but everyone else is new also so it equal gun fights <emoji>
__label__helpful fortnite is an ok game but it needs improvment this game has changed too much over the past few months and some stuff in the game is dumb <emoji>
__label__unhelpful it finally comes down to me and a few others left . i have great loot and in a good position to get to the next circle . i start up my dune buggy and make my way through the woods until suddenly , my screen turns black and sends me back to the xbox home screen . i attempt to join back in the match and find myself dead due to my exposed vehicle . the amount of times i have had my game crash is absurd . video games are for me to be entertained not stressed out . i have also experienced a bug to where i can not scroll through my inventory and causes me to not aquire most of the loot i need in order to survive . another thing that would make the game easier to play would be the amount of time it takes for buildings and other objects to load in . it sometimes traps me in walls eventually killing me . the game needs more effort from all game producers because future games will run this game over with a truck . thanks for your attention .
__label__helpful love how you can play with other people and mcpe , its really great ! however , it needs mod support and a few more updates like stained glass and more redstone powered items . still , great game and i enjoy playing ! the one thing that really bothered me was not mod support , modding gives the player a far more better experience for minecraft , it just really gives it that kick !
__label__unhelpful fortnite is better . so salty to sue epic . you loose . <emoji> good thing i previewed . so over priced . <emoji>
__label__helpful what started off as a good idea , into a nightmare of an experience . playing on the x <num> x continues to get worse . all latest xbox exclusives make you wonder if this as good as it will get for xbox . wish i invested more into my pc rather than believe x <num> x would be a game changer .
__label__helpful this game rewards a steady hand and requires skill to get anywhere in it . newer players trying to get into it by going into straight into multiplayer will more than likely have their view of the game ruined by a high ranked player trolling in casual . ranked isnt as bad , but if you arent skilled enough , the other players might vote kick you . if youre okay with a somewhat toxic community , a few bugs , and slightly laggy servers , i would recommend trying this game , its very well thought out . its fun if you have a competitive edge and take the time to learn and get better at the game . each person has their own way of playing this game , and this game can cater to that .
__label__helpful so after hesitating (and for good reason) , i downloaded the game . the first thing i see is servers are too busy , try again later . wtf man really ? so after spamming the retry button , i finally got into a game . kind of . i didnt even see the spawn island . instead , im left listening to the plane flying with a black screen to stare at . then it loads only for me to see the plane is already half way across the map . awesome . so i jump out , land and get stuck in a rendering building for <num> minute . again , awesome . it finally loads and i gear up a little bit . i come across an enemy , shoot him and nothing happens . he shoots back , i die . ok i figured , first game and im new here so its cool . well apply this same exact scenario a second time . and then a third time . i couldnt even attempt a <num> th because the servers wont load . i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt , but i feel like bluehole just robbed me . new map ? how about fixing the game instead of adding more content we cant use !
__label__helpful this game is amazing . by far , my favorite thing to play . the only reason why it is four stars is because i really think there should be a free way to earn coins . i know it was always spend money to get something , but many games allow you to earn free coins to spend on something in their store . this game is otherwise the greatest . mojang never ceases to amaze me on what they can create .
__label__helpful its not unplayable in its current state , but its far from being good . it has many glaring issues , while also not being optimized very well . moral of the story , wait a couple months and let the developers fix some issues and optimize it well , then buy it for a more enjoyable experience .
__label__unhelpful its still a good game . a lot has changed since the beginning though . a bit of nostalgia .
__label__helpful i went ahead and bought the $ <num> version of the game to play with <num> friends plus me and had planned to have a great experience with building fortresses , shooting zombies , playing with friends , and gathering lots of loot . the first <num> weeks felt like it was all going to be worth it . but after all the repetitive gameplay , and lack of worthwhile rewards . i pulled the final straw when they deleted my castle , which i had <num> pieces left a place on the map . and now i have <num> stacks of stone sitting in my bank reminding me that all the <num> hours of work i put in to my castle of solitude was for nothing . dont come to this game if youre looking for a creative outlet and some fun gameplay that will last you more than a week .
__label__helpful great graphics , realistic shots , love being able to put on attachments . and the updates with a different map add on .
__label__helpful secretly they use bloom for a gun fights , which means it is more luck based not skill based .
__label__helpful its been a few months now . the updates have made gameplay a bit better slightly . there is still lag here and there . still random crashing though few and far between . still getting rendering issues . and the dang random invisible pixel crap when driving vehicles is just getting out of control . the whole hitbox thing needs a major fix , the spread is so random . you can be a . d . s . right on target and you have about a <num> chance of hits registering . also vehicle spawns are waaayyy to random . i understand this is prerelease and you are surely partial to your pc version . i love the game , but at this point there is no way i could recommend paying for this game in its current state . but i will keep playing till i cant stand the frustration anymore .
__label__helpful this game currently is the definition of a pay to win (progress) game . it got horrible roll rates , even when buying llamas youll get crap or dupes . upgrading doesnt change rarity . if you want a certain character you better be lucky or willing to drop alot of money . no good rewards the collection bonus gives a good reward at <num> then nothing till <num> , then <num> really ? crashing alot excepted of a beta but you have to pay to play right now which doesnt really make it a beta . beta are tests this is a full buggy game that they charging you for and calling it a beta . well this is early access well tone down buggy and up the rewards so far the game got a good concept but it lacks the reward
__label__unhelpful dont waste your time on this game , the weapons are so unbalanced that it either take <num> bullets to the chest kill one guy then <num> to the head to kill the next . the amount of modders are insane . i cant tell you how many times someone spawned a minigun out of nowhere as soon as we drop then destroy me . if you want my advice , go spend the $ <num> for pubg . my friend has it and its so much better .
__label__helpful it doesent let me play !
__label__helpful almost unplayable , and if youre looking to buy it , dont , if youre new and people see that theyll kick you or kill you (your teamates will kill you)
__label__unhelpful it may be just like pubg but i think its better <emoji> , the cartoon look is amazing <emoji> ‍ <emoji> but not only that because they keep updates regularly so you always have something to look forward to <emoji> , they also added building and i think the building is one of the best things about this game , the game is still in beta so its fine with some glitching , they just need to make it less luck base <emoji> , but other than that great game epic games one of the greatest games so far ⚔
__label__unhelpful i cant connect to the server i want to play on and i cant use my original username to play on it because its already taken . why do we have to connect to xbox live ?
__label__helpful drop rates still trash , no additional sold outfits ? we are not pc . there is no market for this . also , vehicles flip again . dying from sudden vertically challenged vehicles .
__label__unhelpful does not have the same features as minecraft <num> . <num> . its as if its a pc version of minecraft pe . can be updated and added with the newest stuff .
__label__unhelpful unless you want to waste <num> bucks on this piece of garbage game , i wouldn’t buy it . this is the most pointless game , why get this when you can get the the better version where you can actually get mods . the only reason this version is a thing is because the money loving jerks at microsoft want to rob you of your money . dont buy it .
__label__helpful i just preordered and it looks amazing ! im looking foward to this game . i love survival games <emoji>
__label__helpful this is not the equivalent of the java version of the game , it is a port of pe so you are able to play with pe players as long as you are on the same wifi . when it says xbox live multiplayer , that does not mean that you can play with people on their xbox , it means that if someone has an xbox account , you can play with them on windows <num> , not xbox <num> one . if you have a friend with this game , that means you can play together on the computer . the only cross play option is with pe . your java doesnt go void when you claim your windows <num> edition . you obviously need an xbox account to play multiplayer . and finally remember it is in beta , so it will be mildly buggy , and is incomplete . they are most likely working on an update to this game to make it a little bit more practical and entertaining . if you ask me it is worth it . the <num> star reviews are people not knowing what they are doing .
__label__unhelpful even on the lowest settings the mouse sensitivity is ridiculously high , to the point of the game being barely playable , that is if you dont mind getting sick in less than <num> seconds .
__label__helpful fun and a little tense . side note : for every <num> nice player there is ten willing to kill the team because he thinks its fair and that theyre better , but quite oftenly thats completely wrong .
__label__unhelpful the game is fun , i love the features , but microsoft store is bull i already had the game but it wont let me reinstall it on a different computer and it says i have to buy it again to get a new key since i already redeemed my key . it wont show up in my library even though ive played the full version on another computer . microsoft store and mojang service is terrible . i looked it up and you cant redownload it on any device . its basically a onetime install , so if something happened to your computer and it erased all files ? you have to waste another <num> dollars to buy a game that doesnt even allow mods .
__label__helpful i really like the new add on feature , and i think that itll be an amazing addition to the community , but the problem i find with it is that theres no real tutorial to get into the files and make your own . i have some cool ideas buuut i cant for the life of me figure out how to start . i watched the video of searge make the alien invasion skeleton , but thats about all the love there is for add ons . i think it would benefit the community if you had an easy to find demonstrational tutorial that shows where all the files are , how to edit them , and what certain features entail . thanks for the hard work youve put into this update , id just like to know how it works ! cx
__label__helpful it would make the game more enjoyable if we have leads saddles and horses .
__label__unhelpful i like the fact you are making it for windows <num> , but whenever i try to play this version on my laptop i cant . it loads up fine , and i go into one of my worlds , but as soon as i left click all of my controls lock up . my mouse will not turn my view , and my keys do not move my character . i am not sure if i am the only one with this problem , but i cant even play the game unless i want to place one block at a time , then force close the game with task manager and do it again . sometimes the game will close randomly after i have clicked as well . can someone please help me out with these problems ? i have minecraft for pc , xbox <num> , ps <num> , and pe , but w <num> edition just does not work for me .
__label__unhelpful people need to chill about the lag and crashin it is still in game preview and is not fully released . btw this is the best <num> player pvp ive ever played and this game is <num> x better than fortnite !
__label__unhelpful your system doesnt find my live account
__label__helpful this last update made the lag worse than it was before . needs fixed asap
__label__helpful obviously for poor white people and virgins
__label__helpful this game went downhill with all these updates , they try to fix things that arent even broken but leave bugs unfixed , and they keep adding pointless weapons each week why dont they just add <num> with <num> update ?
__label__unhelpful i tried to customize my avatar and just pressing a button locks in everything and boots you to the main menu ! trying to recustomize your avatars appearance costs <num> bp . this is screaming out ripoff also the shooting mechanics are severly fd up and i mean a whole lot
__label__helpful this pvp is garbage . weapon damage is completely broken , weapon color means nothing . every shotgun will one hit kill you unless you are the one shooting . at least pubg has a damage table that doesnt change .
__label__unhelpful the amount of tryhards in this game makes it impossible to play for casuals or noobs like me , but it is possible to have fun . however , there is one thing wrong . they lock cool visual upgrades behind the battle passvbucks microtransactions . if you cantwont buy them , they will send annoying emails telling you to buy it .
__label__unhelpful epic screwed up bringing back skull trooper updating this game so much who agrees fortnite is dieing remember the old days like they show in the trailer who misses when building wasnt your biggest concern and rember whe all of you who played in season <num> how there was tac sub grey pump purple tac now its whoever canget to that scar i remember my first win when i bush camped and got that snipe and ended someone with a green ar near dusty depot they need to stop adding crap and repair dust and brind back that smg you won your first game with over at moisty or how you <num> pumped a sqaud with a grey pump i say bring back the good days
__label__helpful ive spent years watching minecraft videos on youtube , so i was very excited when i purchased minecraft for myself and began playing it . and while its very fun , theres still tons of room for improvement in the windows <num> edition . while calling this particular version stripped down might be unfair , ive learned (the hard way) that this edition is based off of the earlier pocket edition of minecraft , which lacks many of the features of the original pc edition . what id really like to see added to minecraft : windows <num> are more options that enable people with slower pcs to play the game without worrying about big performance issues . (minecraft , after all , is a surprisingly resourcedemanding game ! ) thats the main thing id like to see added to this edition , but there are also other changes id like to see made . some of the blockitem types (stained glass , for example) and structures (woodland mansions , for example) should really be added to future updates to improve gameplay .
__label__helpful want to know where all the scummy xbox players are ? look no further .
__label__helpful i got on rainbow , and then my year <num> and year <num> operator are gone . they were there yesterday ( <num> ) and now they are gone . hoping its a bug . i got these operators with the season passes . anyways , good luck with this game . its a pretty good fps game ive played in a while .
__label__helpful it has bugs , issues , and crashes but it game preview so expect this but over very well done . and to go first person is rb
__label__helpful your game is no wonder it gives people anger problems just take it down from the store .
__label__helpful on the regular version of minecraft i usually always changed the controls so that rightclick was my break and leftclick was the activation buttons but i cant in this game . its really messing me up and i would like it to be fixed . other than that the game is great so far (besides a few minor bugs) and i look forward to it in the future .
__label__helpful just waiting for the crossplatform multiplayer to reach the xbox one version !
__label__unhelpful anyone who plays fortnite is a <num> yr old little kid
__label__unhelpful the hype is not real .
__label__helpful i dont like the animals and the updates . i love them ! so i want a new update so that way we have stained glasspanes . so maybe if you just . also get like , in the next update you can just . go ahead and . maybe leave a tutorial on how to install mods ? i really need help with that . >_< : | other wise , i luv it !
__label__unhelpful seems to be a port of the pocket edition , runs smooth but lack of game option is disappointing . better to spend your money on the actual version until support is improved , simply put the quality just is not what is should be .
__label__helpful update lags me to the point cant run or walk . other players load and kill me within seconds due to that . takes maps longer to load than before . pretty much unplayable . not worth buying right now .
__label__unhelpful keeps freezing up . after several , as few as <num> , actions it freezes up and you sit there waiting for it to free up again . really frustrating . i have died lots of time cause when it frees up sometimes it takes off running off cliffs , into lava , etc . dead you are . i know i did not pay much for the game but i think it should work better than it is . come on guys lets get this working better .
__label__unhelpful my seasons . pass dont work
__label__unhelpful make your own house . play with your friends . you can do anything . have your mom getting mods for you . get cute skins . get gold . protect your self . food . pictures . i cant believe what you can do ! get or else . (not creepy u are) its fun join us the cool kids cause you are missing out
__label__unhelpful good , but java is better
__label__helpful runs really well on most computers since it runs in c++ instead of java and while it is not as up to date as the java version still has a good variety of blocks and materials . the interface for the xbox app functions well and the ability to use a controller is a big plus . i hope they can catch up to the java version soon though , there are many cool things that would be good to have in this version like beacons .
__label__helpful full release still getting ablack screen at beginning of every round . none of my friends seem to experience this . can anyone offer a fix ? playing on xbox one s . thanks
__label__unhelpful sometimes the game crashes and sometimes when you click you cant move or you keep moving in one direction and cant look around . also , sometimes you have to keep clicking repeatedly to break a block . other than that the game is great !
__label__helpful great and fun shooter game with creative skins and emotes
__label__unhelpful im starting to shoot threw players making the game unplayable this is never gonna get fixed very disappointed pubg had the most potential but now its just dying (update) its getting worse i cant believe i spent money on a broken game (update) frame rate makes the game unplayable and frags dont kill any chance i could return this waisted space ?
__label__helpful i love all versions of minecraft but this one allows me to play with my viewers on the xbox platform as well . bettertogetherupdate . the open world design of minecraft allows for your imagination to run wild and play how you want . are you into going up against the environment & surviving against all odds ? you can ! do you like to pvp against your friends & see who is the king of the world ? you got it ! do you like to build fantastic worlds from the ground up ? oh yeah you can do that too . but there is so much more . the marketplace allows you to get so much more content . i love loading up my realm with some new & exciting content from the marketplace and playing with my friends and viewers . i have been playing minecraft for <num> + years now because there is so much to do . updates add new content to the base game & other people add so much more ! i would love to see them implement the ability for adminsmods to be able to add or remove people from the realms but really thats my only complaint !
__label__helpful this game is good . this game takes some getting used to because they crammed alot of buttons options in the controller but once you master that then it becomes real fluid . remember its still a pre release game the graphics will be updated ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful when i land in a desserted place , i get killed from no where . plus this game sucks and playerunknowns battleground is better .
__label__helpful unlike anything in the market . they really went all out on this game . super fun and addicting . this makes up for the division .
__label__unhelpful only fun part is gliding around in the glider at the beginning looking at the view of the pretty island . chopping trees is cool and all to until somebody with a stupid gamertag ruins it all by shooting me . its . i am going back to farmville to grow plants in peace
__label__helpful this game sux . all the little kids get horny for it . <num> would not beat my meat over
__label__unhelpful this game is lit fam . hit me up for dem chicken dinners .
__label__helpful founders get nothing but random loot crates . it takes far too long to progress . have a favorite class from the trailer ? be ready to grind for hours and hours before playing it . find a cool gun ? be ready to grind to craft it . enjoying your loot ? be ready to grind when it breaks . no reason to pay $ <num> for a f <num> p grind
__label__helpful this shouldnt be a game
__label__unhelpful whats the name of that song that goes bee boo boo bop , boo boo beep ?
__label__unhelpful i own a laptop , so playing this off of that makes it easier . but i own minecraft on the ipad , and i didnt want to spend $ <num> on a game i own already , and dont really like . so after playing <num> o minutes of the free version , i guess ill write my review . keep in mind that the free version is pretty limited . anyways , i dont see any thing different . sure , i may not have seen a few things before , but i mean , come on . its the same thing you can get off of the ipad , just with better controls . i have no idea what multiplayer is like , remember this is the free version . crafting is a bit of a pain , and even more so when you dont get any tips . heres what the free version has ; no creative , no tips on how to do things , no multiplayer . i dont see any need to buy this , unless you love minecraft . hope this was helpful . ~peace all .
__label__unhelpful xbox one controller support is finally here ! wish i didnt have to have a gold account to play locally on lan .
__label__helpful i love this . no questions asked .
__label__unhelpful every time i try to download it says error <num> x <num> f <num>
__label__helpful this game is getting worse . how the hell does the menu run so bad ?
__label__helpful <num> update : its still broken . <num> when i open up this game it brings me to a screen with a play button , which i click and it bring up a new window that tells me i need to log into a xbox live account ? it wants me to agree to some terms by clicking next but when i click next it just reloads the same page telling me to press next . cant even play the game so this is pretty awful .
__label__helpful fix the shotguns and take out smgs
__label__helpful it is super addicting because you never wanna stop crafting and building .
__label__helpful this is a great competitive game with tons of content . the game from its outside may feel repetitive , but when you play each round feels different and unique . i have been playing this game for almost a year now and it almost never gets old !
__label__helpful how is this the exclusive game for the most powerful console in the world when it cant even sustain <num> fps ? how has it been out for three months yet i havent seen one fps improvement ? why does at least one person in my squad disconnect every game ? why does it look and feel like im playing n <num> goldeneye in <num> ?
__label__helpful this game is very great and microsoft and mojang did a really great job . i found that this game is so great because this game dont let your creative end and the fact that they added addon the game just got a lot better and i love this game also because we can make your own server , even a small or big survival or minigame server we can made it and there are also plugins on server that makes everything better . thats like making a game inside game , and thats incredible and the better together coming soon update makes minecraft even bigger in any platform . and what i worries is when minecraft developer tired or minecraft died . its really sad for me and for all the communites member , i really like being a minecraft player . i usually make command block and stuff but i never post it online because i dont have the courage to do it . kid my age dont make stuff they use stuff . this game is brilliant i am one of those old minecraft pewindows <num> player . and the game is now so great then before
__label__helpful a game with so much potential but with so many problems ! the lag is horrible , the games controls are horrible , the overall gameplay is horrible . along with that so many people hack on this game and makers do nothing about . for example , how is it that i unloaded a legendary rifle in a players back each round making contact just for him to turn around and shoot me in the foot while having <num> hp and shield and i die . by the way it showed him with full hp and shield . ask anyone who plays this game and theyll probably tell you its horrible too .
__label__helpful the concept of the gameplay is normal , just like the older version . no problem , yes the windows <num> version is due to update . but mojang wont add a lot of the features that are in the normal minecraft (not windows <num> ) . i want them to add the feature that you can place <num> blocks high instead of two , when you are high up . i also miss the regular minecraft (in general) . when i play servers like hypixel or mineplex . theres only a couple of things you could do .
__label__unhelpful well , ive been using the original minecraft for years , and i have gone through the process of redeeming the code and it still attempts to charge me . i have talked to support , with no help at all . i wish mojang would try a little harder sometimes honestly .
__label__helpful shotgun are not as in s <num> specifically the pump you can shoot some in the head <num> and body shot for <num> and you cant even finish people when their down you cant even finish them it shows the hitmarker but no damage
__label__unhelpful the best game i have played on all platforms . i would say that the servers still need more work and the rest is just perfect . ops wrong game , this is not gta <num> (jk)
__label__helpful dude the lags are killing the game
__label__unhelpful laggy as hell , horrible graphics , and very frustrating . i want my <num> bucks back <emoji>
__label__helpful its fairwell a great game but its hard to get expensive ops , and its ridiculous for $ <num> a op thats actually good , and for poor gamers it would take months to just get a good op . and noobs (recruits) cant play the casual without a lvl <num> + toxic player killing them . and often theres lag from a poor gamer that is host . and they need <num> rknwn costing ops , to cost <num> rknwn that would help alot , and i cant just get <num> rknwn every game , i need a faster way
__label__unhelpful this is a great game , but its kind of weird when i try to make a new world . i dont really like the world types : old , infinite , and flat . with old , the world is very small with one biome . with infinite the world is very glitch and it generates slow since there is no limit to its size . with flat really were just missing the customize option . now about the update . give us shields ! you gave us a shield slot but we still cant duel wield . and for some reason there are no fireworks . overall this is a great game but it needs work . ps : you should change the world options to classic , small , medium , and large like in the xbox one version
__label__helpful i love how it all fits toghether in my brain like if it was made for me <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i love this game <emoji> for all the people complaing its a game preview for a reason . its an unfinished game so of course its not going to be perfect . if you dont like it then dont play its that simple . i cant stand people that expect perfection with a game preview . grow up !
__label__helpful well , minecraft is a very good game . i really like it a lot man . man u mojang people u r the best . but still in minecraft there are some lackings like u could add a few more animals more hd textures and new items and specially dual wielding in minecraft
__label__unhelpful updating my review to <num> star , now that its working on lowerend tablets as well . my kids and i are very happy so fun to play with each other across our phones and tablets !
__label__helpful even though its in early access and rough around the edges , pubg is the best tactical shooter on xb <num> . the gameplay reminds me of the original rainbow six , ghost recon , and socom games mixed with the arma series . definitely worth thirty dollars .
__label__unhelpful it seems to have a bit of input lag , mainly with looking around . now this could be because of a fps lock or vsync . its pretty much pocket edition and doesnt have as much content as the regular java version . for touch devices this is a really good port , and thats probably the crowd its focused at .
__label__unhelpful i am using my surface to play minecraft , and it confuse my left click with my right click its really annoying . i would be nice to able to change it so it can be a key board command so will stop destroying things when i want to place a block .
__label__unhelpful cant get through one game without lagging out . im done playing for a few months . maybe these morons will fix the issues that need to be fixed to make the game actually playable instead of tweaking the characters hair . great game if it was playable . hold on to your $$$ for now at least . update . still lags horribly and lags you out every game . aiming is also horrible as well . these idiots will write these reviews trying to remind you that its a game preview and its not finished yet . we know , you idiots ! people read these to find how the game is , not how its going to be .
__label__unhelpful ive been playing minecraft for a long time and for a while i was kind of getting bored of it , but i just fell in love all over again . i dont know why but this is way better than the original minecraft , fun , addictive , and faster ! im defiantly buying this < <num>
__label__unhelpful i love the game . its easy to download . but i cant change the way im looking on the key board . i am always looking at myself . also , i cant make my own skin . : ( its ok
__label__helpful i love the new update it is amazing so much cool items and other stuff the one thing i cant figure out is duel wielding when will you add shields to thank you so much for adding !
__label__helpful this is a game preview its going to have bugs . it will be fixed in time . so give it a chance at full release . it has potential .
__label__helpful this games launch is a joke first of all . however my biggest issue is the fact that no where in the description of the game that you buy is there a warning that this is infact a closed beta . the game is in shambles as far as i can tell , which would be fine if i had been givin a warning as to the fact that it is not a full game that will be release in the spring of <num> . some of you may say i should have looked at game reviews . but i should not have to use game reviews to find out if a game is prerelease or not . overall , just dont buy this microtransaction garbage .
__label__unhelpful get an ar and shoot someone in the back . all other guns are pea shooters . stealth not included .
__label__helpful i love the game , it is very fun and time killing . the only problem i really have with the game is it crashes all the time now . i havent been able to play for quite a while , and i would like to play again .
__label__unhelpful items that are missing : maps , pressure plates , horses , ender pearls , eyes of ender . i will update this list as i find more . also , i cant trade with villagers . when i am playing it is forcing me to be connected to wifi , even though i am only playing by myself . i dont want to be online . its stupid that i cant just play the game without wifi . when i am connected to wifi , the game constantly freezes and is impossible to play for more than a few minutes . the game keeps shutting itself off when im playing . every time it does this the game glitches and my flatland becomes a tiny strip of flatland surrounded by walls of water , lava , caves , and stones . flying to the top always reveals a infinite world , and it means i cant keep that world and the project i was working on . i have to start over .
__label__helpful give this a like if you love our lord tachanka but in all reality this is the closest youre gonna get to a real shooting game . it takes a lot of skill to be good unlike cod where any noob can be good .
__label__helpful i like it , i give it <num> stars its a great fun game its connected to pocket edition but the texture packs are still coming to the pc windows <num> edition and pocket edition i cant wait till theres armor stands and llamas .
__label__helpful im so excited for version <num> . <num> . <num> or known as <num> . <num> !
__label__unhelpful it says save the world will be free in <num> but its not . wtf
__label__unhelpful i cant even get the up date
__label__unhelpful also its to popular and overrated . <emoji> agree . <emoji> disagree
__label__unhelpful this game . piece of , cant hear anyone around you . also cant fix the
__label__unhelpful you play stupid game get nothing but stupid rank also stupid is little kids begging thier parents to buy stupid costumes and stupid emotes stupid game its just stupid too many updates
__label__unhelpful constantly getting teamkilled by theses racist people . can never enjoy a match always wondering are thes guys going to teamkill me video proof but i get baned for cursing at them . just got teamkilled at another team was working wwith him . n othing happens to them just the black dude gets banned . garbage land no near no loot search five houses finally get a gun but die from two bullet with a vest a helmet i shoot dude in the face five times but i die from two bullets . fix your game . died again cause every house i go in has nothing bbut pistol grips and pistol ammo but no guns . until enemiesshow up with scars and aks and i get no time to pick up the gun load it and switch frining rate . im dead from two bulets ump vs scar who dies ?
__label__helpful the multiplayer is fun , but just after an hour of gameplay , it begins to feel repetitive . most games i play would usually contain a variety of multiplayer moods . having only two different modes to play can easily get dull . to be honest , i like this game , but it lacks the desirable qualities i see in most games . with only having this game for a few hours , i still havent developed an entire opinion . because of this block , ive given rainbow six siege a five star rating . (if you actually read this all the way , youve received my deepest respect for being a truth seeker . <emoji> )
__label__unhelpful really fun and alot of potential . alot of fixes to come ahead . but people forget game is still in alpha and not a finished product
__label__unhelpful game will not play . there is just a blank green screen while music plays in background . have done updates and troubleshooting but still not success .
__label__helpful good but i wis i could play with ps <num> players
__label__helpful its a wonderful game well worth the price i paid for it i hope to see an update whereas we can trade with the villagers like in the console versions other than that its a great game
__label__helpful very fun and addicting game though it lacks a lot from the pc version . im excited to see how far this game will go . one of the best perks of this version is being able to quickly log on to friends worlds . however it is frustrating having to wait for the mobile to keep up and vice versa . there are minimal bugs for it being in a beta version , however the bug they need to fix is when trying to get on someone elses world it will say connecting to server or something and wont actually load . they said it was a computer problem , however my laptop is up to date and it continues to happen . only other issue is updates take forever , and i know i cant blame the game for this , i just have to be patient haha .
__label__unhelpful i love this game but , whenever me and my friend play and we are vs <num> more group , we lag out the game or lag out and get killed and this isnt the first time . i find it suspicious how this happens in the top <num> everytime and this has happened to friends also . update : this game is a really good game , devs always up to date slowly improving and i dont know why it has such bad ratings with a game that is very fun . also , dont complain . its <num> free : )
__label__unhelpful i am a previous owner of the pc version of minecraft . i got the free download code , and i redeemed it . everything was fine at first , but apparently , i cant download my game . i redeemed the code back in august of last year , and i havent been able to play the game . i have tried everything to get the game up and running , but the store still has the purchase and free trial options . i think i would actually ike the game , if i could get the download up and running (like it should have during august of last year . ) ive checked every forum and q & a page for a solution , yet ive found none (minecraft windows <num> doesnt even show up in my recent downloadspurchases pages) . ive spent over <num> hours total trying to find a solution . what a waste of time .
__label__helpful great game fun to play with your family . creative and enjoyable to play .
__label__unhelpful this game adds more features like auto jump its great for people who get tired easy by pressing the space button and third person as an option from the menu plus the sound affects sound great like the spider for example it sound more like a spider in real life so i look forward to this games official release .
__label__unhelpful pubg is a way better game . for pc . fortnite is a <num> yo tryhard magnet . pubg is way more realistic and dosent have <num> yos breaking controllers and spamming a to jump fortnite is sht
__label__helpful looks like a turtle took a and shoved it in a vagina .
__label__helpful microsoft has done a fantastic job with this minecraft remake , it runs beautifully smooth on any hardware , has controller support , xbox live integration , and is just generally a great version of the game . ill likely still play the original for online since i can play crossplatform and run my own dedicated servers , but this is a great way to play single player or with realms without any setup or lag .
__label__helpful run smooth on my bad computer i wish it had end
__label__helpful if you dont have friends to play with , you need to spend your money elsewhere ! otherwise prepare for the most toxic gaming community on xbox with a whole lot of random teamkills and votes to get kicked from game for literally no reason at all . also prepare for a very terrible matchmaking experience that puts you in already lost matches with a <num> score , makes you join matches where you have to sit out the whole first round , makes you join matches against high ranking players that are partied with their friends , while you have low ranked newbies as your teammates . but with friends , the game is really fun ! <emoji>
__label__helpful the game is great . i love it . performance is awesome . but where is the ability to pause ? i came from the pc version . whenever i want to pause the game to leave and do something , i hit the escape button . sometimes i do this in this game without realizing it and when i come back , i have died . i cant work out why it has to be like this . im getting used to just quitting to the main menu , but why is this a thing in the first place ? its so annoying .
__label__unhelpful you can just jump around people with a shotgun and kill them . pubg is the answer .
__label__helpful the frequent blackscreen crashes seem to have gotten better . graphics still take long to render upon landing , rubberbanding also seems less frequent . still a long way to go , but much better than first <num> weeks
__label__unhelpful does youre game have negative to ok reviews ? no problem ! instead of working on the base game , so every mission doesnt feel the same , just try to capitalize on pubgs popularity . <num> for fortnite <num> for battle royale .
__label__unhelpful its good , lots of potential using c++ or java . i really dont know . but paid skins ? thats the dumbest thing more dumb then a guy with <num> brain cell . sorry got mad and i should be . other then that pretty good so far !
__label__helpful i have played minecraft for <num> years (since <num> . <num> . <num> ) and i absolutely love the game . while the original version is overall superior , in terms of optimization , the windows <num> edition is far superior to the original version . another thing i love about this version is the userfriendliness . although i know how to setup a server for the original version of minecraft , i appreciate how this version is extremely easy to use for the newcomers to the game . just start a world and boom , you instantly have a server that others can play on (even people with pocket edition can join too ! ) the while on the original version it can be a bit more annoying at times . however , it is lacking modding and some features from the original version . also , having to pay for texture packs is egregious and ridiculous (texture packs on the original are free) . once it gets the features from the original version , it will be the quintessential version of minecraft because of the incredible optimization .
__label__helpful updated (again)) : as said previously , this game runs wonderfully better than the traditional java version of the game , keeps most elements while doing so , and tops it off with multiple ways to play the game (touch , keyboardmouse , gamepad) . minus the frequent crashes , with the new updates the game has been having , the ui is now mostly migrated from the pocket editions elements , making the game feel much better . there is an instant switch between touchkeyboardgamepad , for when you press a button or preform an action the game instantly adjusts to what device you just used . this is useful for switching to a controller if you want to relax . now that i have an xbox <num> controller to play around with , using it with minecraft : windows <num> edition was almost flawless . the only thing i noticed that could be a possible downside was the sluggish inventory navigation , since crafting is a thing . sprinting was also difficult as it didnt have its own designated button . thats about it .
__label__helpful honestly game was fun earlier , but this game has so many bugs and they dont even fix them . now its the worst game ive ever played .
__label__helpful i like how there are a lot of features , but i dont like how i cant load a world from the java edition . there needs to be a converter engine . then , and only then will i be completely satisfied with the game .
__label__unhelpful after a painful purchasing process , i finally was able to get the windows <num> version . after a few minutes i found that this was a windows <num> pe edition . no clarity is made on the product name so its up to the user to guess and hope or somehow be aware of the many versions . refunds (if possible) are not easy to find on the web site .
__label__helpful great game to waste time building random stuff with friends .
__label__helpful its kinda like csgo at times it has different characters each with a gadget or ability from navy seals or spetsnaz and much more the season pass gives you everything earlier and boosts so its not unfair
__label__unhelpful may as well play it on xbox if you want this style of minecraft . it doesnt support any pc friendly customization like mods or texture packs , the interface is clearly meant to be controller friendly which means awkward keyboard & mouse control , and being forced to make a new xbox gamertag is just ludicrous if you already have a mojang account . the performance is great , but that is to be expected with a very limited version of the game . if you cant afford a new xbox then i guess this game is great , but if you are a pc gamer just stick to the current minecraft client .
__label__helpful epic please try adding bots for no fill playground mode please . thank you
__label__unhelpful great idea , great game but trash programmers . major bug needs priority fix is auto closing mid game
__label__helpful can play with mcpes player pvp
__label__helpful i think the graphics of the game are amazing , but i have noticed a few differences from the current pc version . for starters , torches dont give off very much light at all , and the settings are still oriented to xbox . i play with the attackdestroy button and the place block button reversed , and i cannot find out how to switch that . also , the jump key will occasionally glitch , not allowing me to stop jumping . the game also freezes often . i do love the new look of the villager zombies , and the new graphics though .
__label__helpful this game is wonderful , if ur a fan of fps games i stongly recommend giving this a try . the graphics are great and its addicting to play . its a little unforgiving to newbys but if u put in the time n effort i promise its worth it . now dont just hop n multiplayer take ur time to learn a lil first . this game is not run and gun its tactics new to those of us who fell in love with the cod franchise . its a blast though a little more competitive , but if u play to have fun n u wont put it down . not to mention steady flow of updates n new content every year i give it a <num> all day .
__label__helpful great game but it freezes and the game closes nearly every match i try to play . the buildings also load in late and by the time it does everyone else has weapons . extremely unfair
__label__helpful this game runs fine on my pc when it runs . a few months back it stopped working with no explanation . i click on the icon , the splash window comes up briefly before the program crashes . it worked briefly after i did a graphics card update , only to stop working again within hours . there is no fix that i could find on the mojang website or anywhere else on the net . id give this a <num> if the thing would actually work .
__label__unhelpful any game where you can buy your rank instead of earning it through hours of grinding deserves negative stars .
__label__helpful its unplayable trash at this point , you glitch out of the game while driving walkin running or just lying still . the controls and ui are garbage , key mapping is utter nonsense . gameplay is largely luck based with terrible hit registration and lag . you die from a guy looking <num> degrees away from you , your own character constantly blocks your view inside buildings instead of the camera adjusting towards first person . i would not recommend the game to anyone it needs years to correct . this should be an alpha or beta test never a paid game preview . terrible in almost every aspect , loot is hugely irregular . you see <num> backpacks next to each other or none the whole game . i can overlook many issues but not the vast holes and irregularities in the combat mechanics . deleted the game after playing for a week and getting in the top <num> people on na . the game is a broken laggy glitchfilled nightmare which would take even an aaa developer another year to bring to a beta test stage . abandon ship
__label__helpful been waiting for this forever <emoji>
__label__helpful loving it . its a game preview game so its not perfect . still very fun . amazing graphics on x <num> x . really recommend it . if u like fortnite .
__label__unhelpful i cannot play , every time i try moving and doing things in game i manage to start programs from my quick bar .
__label__unhelpful this game reminds me why i hate first person shooters and it makes it a double whammy cause its also a ubisoft game i will never play another first person shooter again if you play a tom clancy game stick with the division and splinter cell or ghost recon .
__label__helpful i loved this game until season <num> . before it was a great game and was fun . but now it is full of <num> year olds who call you a noob if you dont have a $ <num> skin . now all my friends play fortnite and i am the only one who hates it .
__label__helpful i love the fact that this is almost exactly like the original pc and pocket edition versions of minecraft ; however , it gets rid of many essential features that me and many of my friends at school use . i introduced minecraft to many of my friends at school , and purchased over fifty accounts for each of them . we developed our own custom controls for us to use , but minecraft windows <num> beta edition does not have an option to set custom keyboard controls like pc version does . many of us prefer to play minecraft windows <num> beta edition on our surfaces or pcs over cellphone because we love the keyboard options ; however , we cannot play it fluently because of the lack of control options . other than that , this game is excellent ! its fast ! its fun ! its addictive !
__label__helpful just like the pc version . everyone is on a level playing ground spec wise and its super addicting . pubg on xbox is a must have ! <emoji>
__label__helpful i love this game ! it is so fun but challenging to survive . a new update happened and its amazing ! if you love this game give it <num> stars (p . s . it is <num> d , so , if you dont like <num> d dont get it) !
__label__helpful fortnite is a very enjoyable experience with friends . your mileage may very depending on which version of the game you get and how much time your willing to put in it , but the game has a terrible repetition factor that for people who want a variety of things to do in the game will be disappointed greatly like i was , for those who are ok with this extreme repetition , the games systems , gameplay , and over all structure is great (ha , puns) .
__label__helpful the real version is beter but i like the part that i play whit my frends that they are in there mincraft pe
__label__helpful look , i get as annoyed as everyone else with rubberbanding and game crashes but you cant judge this game the same way you would judge battlefield or rs siege because it is basically in alpha or early beta format . if you really wanted it to be finished , it wouldn’t be on xbox for another year and a half or so and we would all be complaining about that instead . i am personally a huge fan of the xbox game preview program . this game is a great simple game . turn off game dvr in your settings and that also helped me . the game will improve if and only if we give constructive feedback to the developers instead of bashing their unfinished game as a “cash grab” and complaining about server issues and rating with one star . you need to rate it for what the game is , unfinished , glitchy , constently improving , and fun as hell .
__label__helpful i love the pocket edition and win <num> cross over and how its pocket edition on pc ! amazing ! but the shift click is bugged badly , and some of the inventory is bugged . also the xp orbs sometimes bug , and sometimes my items drop by themselves , please fix these and otherwise , really awesome
__label__helpful matchmaking takes ages . but the game is fun
__label__helpful i really like the game i have been here since season <num> but i have one problem xbox doesnt have free skins like ps <num> so xbox needs free skins in fortnite
__label__helpful really fun game when u got a good group i cant wait for more content to come out
__label__helpful minecraft is an amazing game , with endless possibilities ! but there are a few things that upset me : you cant upgrade minecraft into any higher(or lower) version . also , you cant install any mods in this version of minecraft ! this really upsets me , and sometimes makes me not want to play minecraft . i encourage microsoft to enable updates and mods into this version of minecraft to . spice it up , or else , it will take the joy out of minecraft . i forgot one last thing . commands ! i dont know much about commands which explains why every command i try to put in wont work , even the ones they tell me to put in ! as i was saying , minecraft is a game where theres a journey waiting anyone , at anytime . i encourage microsoft to update minecraft and make it mod compatible , ( i didnt really care much for the commands ; ) so that players of minecraft develop an imagination with no limits .
__label__helpful im not sure how a windows <num> beta was going to look like . the gui is very similar to the pocket edition , which is strange playing on pc . there are still bugs . one major bug atm is the sound not working ! how can one survive in the game without listening for creepers and their friends ? the multiplayer feature is confusing at first . im not sure how the join friend will work since it is asking for ip and port . i thought it would be more like the xbox version where you can just click join on your friends name . edit : sound has been fixed thank you ! there is a new xbox live join feature , but i got no friends who has win <num> so i cant test out multiplayer yet . : (
__label__unhelpful i just paid $ <num> for a game i cant even play , seriously ? i finally finished installing the game and i click open the app and it starts to open and then crashes . is this just a scam to get money with no product ? im furious . i should get a refund or a functional game .
__label__helpful it keeps saying that there was an error signing in to xbox live . is there anything i can do to fix it ? its been like this for months . update : i try to sign in n your website but it says that my account is inactive . i tried signing in with a different account but then it says my xbox live account was already linked . please tell me how to reactivate my account . once you fix this i will give a <num> star rating . until then , you are stuck with <num> star . please fix it .
__label__unhelpful ive attempted to return countless times , for the past few weeks , to play this game . i was able to run this game for a short amount of time when i originally upgraded to windows <num> , it has since been updated to <num> . <num> . <num> . after the update , i went into the settings and selected full screen mode and the game froze . since then , every time i load the game i get an immediate freeze upon seeing the title screen . it allows me hear music and select either options or play while clicking other menus does nothing . when i enter either of the two accessible menus , the background spins normally , music play , and thats all . clicking or highlighting anything further will cause the game to freeze while the music still plays . i would love to play this game and buy a second copy to play alongside my so but this is strongly halting me from doing so . tl : dr dont select full screen and avoid picking this up unless you are willing to beta test a broken game or its free .
__label__helpful so far so good . i played on the xbox previously and finally sprang for the pc version . it doesnt lag unless im handling other tasks on my other monitors . my only big disappointment is that saves cant be shared between different computers without physically copying the files and moving them over . supposedly there is a dropbox hack for this but the fact that the game doesnt allow for cloud saves is kind of a letdown .
__label__helpful sure the game pretty glitchy , right now . what game isnt on first release ? even the mainstream ones not in beta or game preview . the game can be as intense as you make it . collect your arsenal , hide , run towards gun fire , snipe , or charge in with a frying pan . this game is fun and put the nerves on high alert .
__label__helpful this is actually surprisingly a decent version of the game . more updated than the console version anyway . however . my one major annoyance is the touch screen mode . im playing on a surface pro , and for the most part , the touch controls work fine . but theres some minor problems that irritate me a lot . for example , it uses the pc crafting menu , which is fine and all , but its not set up well for touch screen users . theres no easy way to pick up or drop a single item out of a stack , making crafting stupidly tedious . some kind of autocrafting menu like the console version or android version would be nice . at least as an option . or at the very least making picking up single items out of a single stack easier . another minor annoyance with touch screen controls , is that you cant manually move the controls around onscreen . the dpad is a bit too low . i keep getting to close to the bottom of the screen when i press down . you also cant disable autojump when touch screen mode is on .
__label__helpful its great & awesome , but it is still in development so has a lot that needs fixing & thats expected . dumb to give a bad rating when its obviously gonna have problems at first . it will be perfect soon . great & awesome game !
__label__unhelpful has a lot of the exact same bugs that are in the java version . pros : very well optimised unlike its java counterpart . biomes are a lot larger and smoother . cons : has horse armour but no horses . very limited graphical options . cant change keyboard bindings , but can change controller bindings . villages and pyramids are very common (found <num> pyramids and <num> villages in my first hour , one desert) . inventory mouse doesnt centre on open , can toss items within the inventory ui , and some pickup glitches . random short bursts of sprinting while walking . no trading with villagers . doesnt tie to any single java update , a lot of features and mechanics are all over the place . not allowed to use community texture packs , only storebought . although it runs well , it seems to be more catered to xbox phone rather than pc . im not really a big fan of how this version is going . the only thing that excited me about it was optimisation , which has always been needed .
__label__unhelpful first off the game is not that fun to play . very boring , extremely slow , choppy , laggy and im running this on xbox one x would not recommend to anyone . ill stick to fornite <emoji>
__label__helpful great game all around . only a few gripes and most will likely be fixed in time . i do however have a huge deal with being shot and not being able to tell what direction im being shot from . i mean i get that there going for realism but in the real world if you get shot in your left or right side or even your front or back your able to tell what direction it comes from . that does not mean your able to pinpoint the exact location of the shooter just the general area . i know that there is blood spatter but it does not work well enough in my opinion . something like . cod has when your hit would greatly help . again in my own opinion . otherwise this game is over my expectations in alot of ways . it is truly a masterpiece in the making and i can only pray that brendan green and blue hole do not make the same mistakes niantic did with go . you are not a small studio anymore you have all the resources you need now . i simply pray they keep up the great work . and dont become complacent .
__label__helpful the title says it all , then they dont get updates out when said , about an hour ? naw more like <num> . ill just stick to a good game like pubg . while im at it ill stick on a better system as well which is my pc garbage .
__label__unhelpful this game is awful it is not woth the money save youre money you die way to easy <emoji> its awful i regret paying for this game
__label__helpful be careful playing this game , its highly addictive . my only problem is shotgun damage , wish they were actually shot guns and not pea shooters .
__label__helpful let me start by saying <num> of the interactions are great , people are and helpful . that being said , the other <num> are team killers , trolls , and rage messages . i cant count the times ive been messaged when i was the last person that i should or that im trash if i die instead of win . i cant count the times someone has teamkilled me because i took their character . when you find a game where everyone is helpful andor communicating this is by far the best and most fun shooter on the market . i absolutely love this game and community , its just a shame we have to deal with this awful pocket of players .
__label__unhelpful plays horrible on console ! slow , ugly and clunky . plus tthey give no return option ! waste of $ <num> . do yourself a favor and get fortnite instead . its free and looks <num> x better than this . buyer beware !
__label__helpful what i love is that this games world looks amazing , or at least it looks way better than it did before . what i dont like it the interface . the original interface looks far better and more organized than the microsoft one , but its still a better world so i dont mind it that much so long as microsoft fixes that bad interface .
__label__helpful i love this game when i heard about the better together update i was so exted
__label__helpful crazy fun squad play . i genuinely hated this game at first , but it turned out to be one of the greatest games ive ever played . what dayz shouldve been . except the blue wall , eff that thing . slow it down or something .
__label__helpful i havent had this much fun gaming since halo <num> lan back in the day . addictingly fun .
__label__helpful controls all over the road (need button mapping) super laggy (understand server overload) fps and hit detection need some work over all not a bad game and when the problems are addressed this will be a better game remember day one give it chance to improve if it doesnt then you throw your tantrum demand a refund (i want it now or ill boycott microsoft and cry and troll the game till i feel better about myself)
__label__unhelpful game is broken dont waste your money ! you have ben warned . i want my money back <emoji>
__label__unhelpful total waste of money rubbish made popular by chinese propaganda . runs and controls terribly even on x <num> x .
__label__unhelpful laggy as not worth the buy
__label__unhelpful ill put it in <num> wordsphrases modders , laggy , trick people for money
__label__helpful to start off this game has a steep learning curve to it and playing from the start isnt easy and very challenging . this game is a fun fps for tactical tryhard players so dont surprised when you die often . the dlc is free but requires you spend time gaining renown(ingame earned money) which you get plenty of from playing matches . ubisoft makes this game more enjoyably every season and i will say this game isnt perferct , but i have played since december <num> and i experienced many problems but ubisoft eventually fixes them . the has more pros than cons .
__label__helpful although lacking the veteran single player , rainbow six : siege delivers a fun , quick , refreshing , arcade like style to the r <num> title . online only , players earn in game credits that they can choose to spend on the individual operators , or an operators gear . from gign , to fbis hostage rescue , and even the navy seals , operators have their own unique tactical abilities and firearms . if you consider this game i suggest learning basic breaching mechanics . team cooperation always helps as well .
__label__helpful you wanna play the most bestest game ever . play this
__label__unhelpful game concept great . the rush to push the game preview out before christmas was greedy and stupid ! you cant make it thru one match without being dropped . the delves should have made sure the preview ran instead of trying to cash in on christmas . i will encourage anyone i know to never purchase any further titles from this company . anyone know how to get a refund from this super greedy worthless game publisher ! every person that bought this game deserves a refund . if this poor excuse for a company cant provide refunds . all unhappy customers should join together and start a class action lawsuit !
__label__helpful i am completely astonished by the lack of effort ubisoft puts into fixing this game . the servers are horrible , the balance of matchmaking for fair games is a joke ! ubisoft has made it very clear they couldnt care less about their game or its players . i highly advise to not purchase this game if your internet is not top of the line . many issues have been out right ignored and will most likely never be fixed . this game and its developers are unreliable and not worth anymore of my or anyone elses time or money !
__label__helpful how am i supposed to play if im constantly rubberbanding and lagging all over the place ? this game is alright , save the worlds hombase storm defense blows . i can atleast get in top <num> , and then die from a guy camping in a house . i literally tryhard , but this game apparently all luck and a little skill so i lose in the most bs ways .
__label__unhelpful this game is amazing and i really dont see any bugs the shotguns do less damage than they used to but that is good because u havee to work for a kill the only bad thing is how muchh vbucks cost which is for cosmetics so it is not pay to win
__label__helpful would you guys be able to update the pictures .
__label__helpful ignore those complaining about fps and lag . this is early access , as in this is not the finished product . they will continue to improve overtime . at its core , this is an extremely fun game that ive put over <num> hrs into on the pc version and am looking foward to playing it with all my xbox friends !
__label__helpful realistic destruction , sounds , and gameplay mixed with a variety of guns , maps , and customization makes each gameround feel different and unique .
__label__helpful this game is far better than fortnite ! it has realistic loot , a bigger map and no silly childish crap like boogie grenades love this game !
__label__helpful slowly making the game worse with every update .
__label__helpful the team behind minecraft for windows <num> (minecraft pocket edition) has been listening to user feedback , and the results are paying off . graphics are more fluid then the java (original) version , and frame rate is good even on a tablet . i wish they would support external minecraft servers or even realms . maybe soon ?
__label__helpful the game starts out fun , with loads of characters , skills , weapons and the ability to build your own bases . problem being that after about mission <num> , you realize that youre going to be playing the same few missions over and over again to make small gains for loads of work , which youll want to bring friends with to play with you , as every mission is incredibly boring , but , both of those qualities are a little more forgivable on a free to play model . in addition , as with every early access game , its really buggy and sometimes the connection becomes so unstable that it is unplayable . this game is also bogged down by the f <num> p model of paying to progress and having good gear and equipment hidden behind loot boxes . so , the tl ; dr , wait until its free to play , as the game is built as a free to play , with all of the annoyances of that model in the paid version .
__label__helpful this game is fun but it is trash ! and dont go saying well your just bad cause thats not why ! i was in a <num> v <num> and i pulled out my pump and it was invisible ! which meant i couldnt shoot it ! im giving it <num> stars because this bug has been in the game for so long and they still havent fixed it ! instead they focus on more important things like squinty eyed in the loading screen background .
__label__unhelpful were do i start ? this game is garbage riddled with microtransactions and dosnt even say anywere on the xbox version that its going to be free to play in a couple months . tutorial is about <num> hours long , yes hours . its way too easy and building a fort is basically useless because you can just throw a couple walls up and be fine and you dont get your recources back at the end of the game . not to mention it takes forever grinding for those recources . do not buy this game it sucks and you will regret it
__label__unhelpful the game is really laggy and glitchy .
__label__unhelpful the game is just a remake of pubg just animated and obliderated every other good game in existance and all people talk about .
__label__helpful super fun , i dont understand all the negativity for a game thats not finished . better than some finished games . look forward to new maps .
__label__helpful this game is a laggy broken mess fix it and if anyone is even thinking about playing this dont
__label__unhelpful the terrible framerate and screen blackouts make this game hard to enjoy . i recomend fortnite over this because it is free and more fun .
__label__helpful i love this game . im addicted to this game . needs more updates and needs to have the things xbox has . overall totally worth the money . i love it !
__label__helpful i love this game ! it cured my cancer <emoji> !
__label__helpful ok , for all you people that are giving it a one star rating you obviously dont understand what a game preview is you need to go back learn how to read and then maybe just maybe you will stop crying about this game because you people dont understand that it is a game preview theyre working on the game to try to improve it . they did not release an unfinished game if you had any common sense in your head you would realize that im sick and tired of games like this getting terrible ratings from people who dont understand how to read . all you have to do is look right at the game cover and it says hey guess what game preview ! so for all you one star ratings that just wanna whine and cry about lag and graphics maybe next time youll just read or dont even buy the game because its ridiculous . keep up the work guys ive seen the progress since the release already .
__label__unhelpful . its a good game but pay more money for season pass year two i dont like it at all <emoji>
__label__helpful the constant crashing of this game makes the game not fun at all . please save your money , untilwhen its patched .
__label__helpful the game is awesome but crashes way too much when taking your squad into a mission and right after you complete one . its done it to me <num> times today <emoji> another thing that needs improvement is the inventory space , instead of having stacked items that are limited to <num> it should be increased to a <num> , <num> or <num> and some epic and legendary weapons break a little to easily so if some mechanic could be put in place for that it would be good . overall this game is good just needs a few tweaks here and there .
__label__unhelpful start window comes up and music starts playing with the blurred background gently spinning around like it is supposed to , but another window keeps flashing on and off on top of the main window and i dont get the opportunity to sign in or anything . it is quite disappointing . hopefully you will fix what is broken or have a suggestion for me so i can move the star . uninstalled and reinstalled . still sucks . added java to my machine in case it made a difference (thought there might be a little java dependency left in the code) but still sucks . i cant fault microsoft for screwing things up , after all , it is what they often do . (note : sometimes ms does great stuff , but all too often they really mess up [pg version of my thoughts]) but why wreck a perfectly great game ? here is the microsoft business formula : buy something that rocks . wreck it . charge more for it , and expect your customers and the original fans to love you for it ? ha ! you must think you are donald trump !
__label__unhelpful i like some of the animations , i also like how smooth it feels when you are walking or running . the only problem i have with it , well , <num> problems , is that the chat doesnt work , and the next one isnt really a problem , just a little annoying , but when you are flying , it doesnt move you to the side a little bit like the pc edition or other editions of minecraft . it kind of bothers me because i am used to it . but otherwise , it is great , also , is there new things in it , i noticed new boats , is that a new feature , or has it been there ? thanks ! ☺
__label__unhelpful laggy and crashes , controls also suck
__label__helpful theyve released several updates and continue to release that improve the game . were getting there .
__label__helpful the servers still suck . the hit registration is broke still and has not been fixed the matchmaking is a continuing problem of being unbalanced in every aspect . they took <num> months of content and turned it into more problems
__label__unhelpful its straight up garbage couple of updates but its still . btw <num> updates of nothing
__label__unhelpful it is the literal copy of pocket edition with maybe a couple added features but is nothing new and is a waste of time stick to regular mc kids
__label__helpful good for epic games to have the where with all to make this type of game
__label__unhelpful guns are broken he graphics are terrible the skins are useless just delet the game the will never bring playground if so im reporting it
__label__helpful there is no way around it , the game has its issues . pubg is actively addressing the problems , which keeps me hopeful . in the end , through the lag and droped fps , i still find this game the most enjoyable online game to play right now .
__label__unhelpful played for about <num> hours and im already bored missions are to easy . zombie things wont hit you if you walk side to side and the constant freeze frame foor three seconds then coming back to getting hit is weak glad i only wasted <num> bucks . not impressed at all
__label__helpful minecraft is so relaxing and fun ! no wonder when i go to put a tag on a video it says : minecraft (awardwinning work) ! in a few words : simply great ! the only complaint i have about this game is the install process took a few trys . otherwise this game is perfect !
__label__helpful the best battle royal by far .
__label__helpful its just like comparing marvel vs dc , halo vs cod , apple vs samsung . dont compare the amount of similarities . judge the game by itself then compare the quality of the game with another , knowing that making different battle royal type games is hard to accomplish . fortnite did make different mechanics and resulting playstyles . the quality of these mechanics are not the best , but i prefer fortnites playstyle compared to pubg
__label__helpful pathetic . bowing down to chinas dictatorship . uninstall .
__label__helpful fornite is falling apart . the game use to be fun now its boring and stale , shotguns are useless because smgs are op , plus the game is nerfing the thing that makes it unique . and that is building along with countless bugs and lags . epic fix your game
__label__helpful i love this game i dont see anything wrong with it . i would rate it <num> stars but a lot of new players are getting confused and thinking this is minecraft : java edition and they are getting ripped off when they couldve gotten the version they were looking for and this ! new players who are reading this make sure to buy minecraft : java edition off of mojangs site dont buy this one
__label__helpful <num> : after a wile you wont be able to type in chat or in a sign <num> : the mouse curser will pop up <num> : this is not a issue but i would like to see more people in a lan world allowed like <num> or <num> . <num> : when i drop something it will be vary small like a bottle of xp will be small and not the normal size . but everything else is fine you should get it i really enjoy playing it well some times i would get mad
__label__unhelpful i have yet to be able to play the game . it says it is already installed but i am <num> sure it is not installed . update : finally installed and i opened it . freezes upon opening .
__label__unhelpful it just reminds me of a old pocket edition version .
__label__unhelpful this game is amazing ! ive been playing for a few years ! and the possibilities are endless ! (like . the end . ill stop . ) but still ! you can do soooooooo much ! notch ! thank you ! wolfy
__label__helpful i got the game in <num> and with the season pass , this has been the best shooter on the market to date . its not mindless like cod was . its morden (like moddern warfare was) . it has fantastic game play & while there is no campaign , it makes up with amazing online play , a situation mode where you can get familiar with the characters . terrorist mode where you can change difficulty levels and work as a squad to eliminate the terrorist threat . in my opinion the most fun is getting aparty with friends and playing online . highly recommend this game .
__label__unhelpful too many teleporting cheaters and invisible traps , poor game in general do not recommend
__label__unhelpful if it seems to good to be true it most likely is . the windows <num> app development environment is meant to do for the desktopconvertiblehybrid pc market what mobile apps have done for apple & google : extort the loyal follower base for every mod , upgrade , and perk . dont get me wrong , there is nothing wrong with the base game and the gameplay is fast , crisp , and as addictive as ever not to mention just as developmentally appropriate for your kids : d just dont expect the mods and other cool hacks youve learned about over the premsft years to work in this version , because they almost certainly wont . not for a long time anyway . feedback for both mojang and msft : want higher ratings on this version ? support the modding community asap .
__label__helpful aside from all the bugs and numerous performance issues , if you can handle all that the game is literally crack(addicting) . its a lot of fun with friends even solo . exhilerating , but this game crashes just about everyother game if not all . thankfully you can rejoin . usually by that time , your dead it takes like <num> + minutes . gg you can get lucky sometimes if in a good spot . biggest beef is the crashing by far everything else is annoying but not game breaking . it was expected . im confident work is being done , be patient theres no wonder why this game has <num> million copies sold and going strong still . it is a lot of fun ! if the performance doesnt get too you buy it . if so wait till it improves . update : crashes less now since patch , but still terrible performance and buggy as all hell !
__label__helpful this game is truly a masterpiece of design . the graphics are incredible , frames always <num> a second for online play and the details are amazingly complicated . this game may be $ <num> dollars , but the game has free play days and goes more than <num> off very frequently . the operators are balanced except for blitz and caviera , (opinion , dont hate) . the dlc and cosmetics are somewhat inexpensive and will give you hundreds of hours to kill in competitive gameplay . this shooter is the most realistic and tactical of its kind on the market , so this game should not be your first fpsshooter . rainbow <num> is also very slowpaced , but at the same time goes by very quickly in the heat of the battle . you should know that this game offers a oneshot headshot no respawn type of gameplay , so if you dont want such a hardcore enviroment , perfect realism , and a slowpaced game , you would probably prefer a game like overwatch . it should be noted that unfortuately <num> of the siege communtity is crazy toxic <emoji>
__label__unhelpful i had <num> armor and <num> health and died by <num> bullet to the chest
__label__unhelpful dude the update is soooo good i recomend buying right now !
__label__helpful fix save the world mode , there are many bugs and crashes in that mode that arent getting any attention . how could you just push what should be a good game to the side and only improve battle royale . save the world should be looking better than br .
__label__helpful ok , ive seen so many <num> star reviews that are poorly made and barely given out any reasons why they dislike this game . if they dislike fortnite , then fine . i dont blame them , its their opinion . but like always , plz dont judge a game because of the communityfandom , that will lead toxic hatedoms to appear . but without that being said , lets talk about the things what i like and dislike about fortnite . the pros : the building mechanic , the art style , the iconic emotes , the item store , (at least its not p <num> w) the outfitscharacter customization system , the gunplay , and killing someone and collecting there loot . the cons : the gameplay is shallow , its unbalanced , the annoying shotguns , sometimes theres glitches , and its repetitive . (overall) fortnite : battle royale couldve been great , but its not . i am glad that its popular , but its a little disappointing but it isnt bad . (final verdict) <num> needs some work . (edit : so ive played save the world mode , and its very good . )
__label__helpful its a lot of fun to play with my friends and family . the updates are frequent and add cool features .
__label__unhelpful this game is total dumpster fire ! do not waste your gigs on this sorry excuse for a game ! it <num> ripped off pubg with a sleazy building mechanic with resources . the graphics are awful even for a cartoon styled game . free to play doesnt matter to me . they could pay me and i still would not download this . you could find better battle royale games on a phone than this . the map is way too small , bullets go all over the place , and the frame rate is dropping like tom brady drops balls . please dont bother getting this piece of garbage game and save up for pubg . you will thank me later .
__label__helpful fortnite should have a turtorial onto how to play this game . and the sad part is . is that people will hunt noobs just for a free kill and if your not tryharding then forget about winning youll die from unbalnce weapons you should have levelskills based matchmaking so . dont download unless you want to get an brand new tv because you broke your tv
__label__helpful its fun and enertaning for all ages
__label__helpful so you want to buyplay a good battle royale game ? well this is not the game for you . welcome to fortnite battle royale , a game such like pubg we might be getting sued for it . we have <num> of a kind weapons . like the pumpshotgun . it has <num> damage per shot but it only does <num> close range . we have the brecci . wait i mean the semiauto shotgun . its supposed to do less damage than the pump , but lets just say , with this weapon who needs a sniper . that brings us to the snipers . specifically the semi and the bolt . each bullet you shoot has a faster drop rate than your prom dates . the theres the rifles . the burst and the full auto . each one is terrible in its own way . the burst has the spray of a pornstar , and the full auto hits like a pea shooter . then the submachine gun , oh and its direct retarded cousin , the tacticle version . both are just god awful , like god wouldnt use these to kill people . hed use the revolver , which has the best accuracy . so in general . just wait for pubg . not this .
__label__unhelpful garbage . also its extremely pay <num> win , so if youre gonna play free , dont bother .
__label__unhelpful love the graphics . thanks everybody for the help .
__label__helpful the game at its core is brutal and unforgiving , something most games lack . while the odd teamkill or kick may dampen the experience , it is still a wonderful tactical shooter . with the constant updates to the gun play or mechanics or even new operators and maps , its always fresh . the only downside is the sheer amount of blatant pay walls (however , theyre generally cosmetic items with no real advantage) .
__label__unhelpful where are the free meme skins ?
__label__unhelpful do not see the appeal of battle royal games , all the cons of good games packed into one sh . t game . better than pubg , but thats not saying much . maybe i just dont get it because i dont eat tide pods .
__label__helpful but the <num> . <num> . <num> for windows <num> have so many bugs , them need to be fixed .
__label__helpful theres like <num> solo side ops , no story , but the multiplayer is great . the game is slow paced , but intense , competitive , and very addictive . <emoji>
__label__helpful minecraft is great because you can do so much with it . it can be exciting with fighting some of the mobs for the first time on a world . it can give you a sense of adventure when you explore the terrain and caves . it allows you to express yourself with building . it can even be relaxing if you tend a farm , or decide to dig up an entire area . or you could simply blow it all up if you choose . the possibilities truly are endless , which is why i can always come back to playing minecraft and sink so many hours into it . the java edition has historically been ahead with features , and while that is still true at the time of writing , this edition (bedrock) has been catching up quickly over the past few months . on top of that , the biggest advantage it has over the java edition is that you can play with your xbox friends on the same world , which as a streamer and content creator helps me connect with more people in my community , which i love !
__label__unhelpful this game is very popular , but i dont see how doing the same thing over and over again is fun
__label__helpful this is the worst battle royale game i ever played . first reason is highly overrated not gonna say any names . second reason the game is pay to look ugly and the skins are ridiculously prices and battle pass is not needed and last not certainly least the worst ripoff of pubg and minecraft both of these game are fun but not fortnite thats all i have to say . if you read this rant do you agree ? also i prefer despacito for life then this mistake .
__label__helpful you carry your team and say that you suck
__label__helpful please add split screen for multiplayer !
__label__helpful there are many operators to choose from and more to come . the game is still updated to this day with a new mode
__label__helpful good rule <num> but game sucks .
__label__helpful like in some other reviews , i agree that this is pocket edition on pc and a tad disappointing . even so , it runs quickly and smoothly , and is absolutely beautiful . im hoping this will be heading towards a time when all editions of minecraft can play with each other so everyone can have fun no matter what machine they are running it on . heres to building bridges .
__label__helpful review of battle royale and save the world fortnite has two game modes , a paid pve , save the world , and a free <num> player pvp , battle royale . i will refer to the modes as stw and br in this review . although i really dont like this game , i will still give an honest , unbias review . to start off , stw is more for a player with time to give , while br is just something to play when your bored or for a player who just wants pure action . i really dont like how epic games focuses primarily on the br game mode , for example , all of the screenshots for the game is the br map . another example is that they changed the whole games name to fortnite battle royale . stw deserves more attention considering br probably wouldnt exist if stw was never made . the building feature creates a unique aspect of fortnite , making it a very popular and competitive game for most ages . overall , epic games does a great job at keeping their game relevant with the weekly content updates and interesting map changes .
__label__helpful i like that as a new minecraft version it adds herds of animals which have at least three animals <num> adult an <num> babies it also has really good graphics and i used to want to play minecraft on windows and couldnt but now i can , but as i play later i find powered rails but the only way to power them is redstone torches which are not even in the game : and lots of other things are also missing like armor stands , but at least i can play it on my windows <num> computer : | and you cant place down redstone in creative
__label__unhelpful i go to shoot people but on thir screen i dont shoot them at all . also the game freezing has to stop . theres also countless number of times where hit detection sucks and it gets me killed constantly .
__label__helpful minecraft means everything to me and the people who play minecraft as well . minecraft has helped me and probably millions of people out in the world today . it makes me understand the world a bit better , and gives me hope to things i want to be or achieve out in the real world . when im sad , i build something thats gets my mind off the pain , of course the game has a few bad things but there is still the bright side about the game . this game has changed the world in some way . hopefully the developers keep getting more great ideas for the game in the future . this game deserves <num> stars & this game , is the first for me to say i am really proud of it . keep up the good work guys ! from : william portillo to : mojang , microsoft
__label__unhelpful the most stupidest control is u have to push lt two time to aim in first person
__label__unhelpful well this is only the beta . i wish i could change the keyboard settings to the arrows . i love the pc edition because u get to do more . this one is missing so many things . it has a lot of bugs . it needs a big update . before i buy those ? i want this to be talents rated <num> star all the way . i already have the pc version and i love it . the bad part is ? i cant use cheat codes . which sucks : ( because thats how i play the game . the one positive thing about this is . a bigger village ! : d i never seen one this big ever ! thats one of the things that i liked . but after all ? its only a beta . i like how the water is very clear in this version and how the color seems more hd . i love when game graphics are in high definition . especially minecraft . its needs a little bit more work . i hate how when u walk ? u hear the crunching of the grass . ___ that is really annoying . and i hate the cow noises . it sounds really weird . and i also hate the noises the character makes when they fall .
__label__helpful we want to play the same game as the world , instead of netease minecraft . please bring back our favorite minecraft . a chinese player
__label__helpful pubg is a great game and people are complaining about the frames and button layout . it is day <num> people every game is not perfect when it releases . also , wyen pubg came out on pc it was full of issues like bad lag and that happens still today . no game is perfect people !
__label__helpful love the game but i wish there where more feature like in the computer ver like armor stand , i would like to have an armor stand and id like tto be able to download my own texture packs like the computer ver . other than having more features this is great : )
__label__helpful although it still has a long way to go before it can supplant the standard java version , this version of minecraft has a lot of promise . the performance is much better than the java version , and the developers keep adding new features . although the features lag behind normal minecraft somewhat at the time of this writing , i look forward to a day when it catches up with the java version (and hopefully adds mod support as well) . its a great pastime ! im a bit bummed that it doesnt have crossbuy with my windows phone and with xbox one , but perhaps that will be fixed when it leaves beta . it also doesnt sync with the cloud , but its not enough of an issue for me to remove a star .
__label__unhelpful i think it sad you guys said it a free preview but we had to pay <num> $ that most of us waisted money we cant get back well played with the sega genesis graphics lagg is horrific worst preview ever stick with pc please it better to watch other play on twitch thank merry christmas happy new year
__label__helpful i love the game <num> . <num> the only thing i think you would want to change is how often you find a new area example i have a world and it has a sand biom that doesnt end for about <num> , <num> blocks and you have to walk all the way across to get to the forest but eventually i did make my own forest on the flat grassy lands but at the beginning it was not that easy but i have made a rail road and im way to in love with the game to stop playing .
__label__helpful lemons lemons why dis gam has no lemons
__label__helpful the game was fun at the start , a way of competition to pubg you could say . now its terrible , its not fair in any way , the community are just a bunch of very rude and immature kids who know nothing more . this game is a pure example that games are not improving , but getting worse . i dont ever want to see this game again .
__label__helpful i just preordered this game and it looks amazing ! still a bit worried about that $ <num> though .
__label__unhelpful while this version shows some potential , this version of mc is pretty much just meant for single player . you cant add any pc servers that you play on , which pretty much defeats the purpose of playing minecraft . unless they do fix this in the future , id say stick with the original version of minecraft .
__label__helpful amazing how such a lightweight game can perform when its wellcoded . the difference between this version and the vanilla java version is night and day in microsofts favor . exactly the lightningfast , buttersmooth experience you should expect from a game of <num> x <num> pixel <num> ^ <num> m blocks .
__label__unhelpful this is literally the pocket edition on pc , just spend the extra $ <num> on the real pc version cause this verion is multiple updates behind and is locked at <num> fps .
__label__helpful i recently got back ino this to play with some friends who just got the game and were all around level <num> . were just sick of being matched against people who are three times our levels in casual games . this game has a fun and unique playstyle , but that fun quickly goes away when in almost every game your matched against significantly more experienced . it also should be noted that no matter how skilled you are in this game youll lose every engagement against another player if they have better internet . this game would be so much more enjoyable if the devs fix matchmaking and fix client side lag comp .
__label__unhelpful no incentives for winning , microtransaction city for cosmetics , play pubg unless your hard up for battle royal with rng aiming .
__label__helpful i love it ! i think it works great , only i wish it could have : enderpearls , pistons , sticky pistons and horses . also there is something wrong with breeding animals . like when you want to breed a cow and u have a stack of <num> its gives the whole stack to the cow .
__label__unhelpful if you dont buy this game you are gonna miss out on one of the best games this year and next year . fxck fortnite
__label__helpful free dlc , but season pass is well worth it ! cant put this game down and even when i do , i keep coming back to it ! hands down , my favorite game on xbox one and top <num> of all time ! but , its not for everyone and you will find yourself questioning the validity of kills here and there . rage quitters look elsewhere .
__label__helpful game is unplayable . you will crash every other game and the frame rate is so bad the enemy players bounce around all over the place . its pathetic . the game devs need to refund everyones money and make this free to play .
__label__unhelpful the game runs pretty well , and switching controls works seamlessly , but basic options from the java version , like hud scaling , are missing
__label__unhelpful people need to get over complaining about this game . its a game preview and it is a work in progress . you need to stop or got play a different game . i enjoy this game for what it is and it is still fun to play . the developers are new to making games and and doing the best they can . give contractive criticism and dont be a sheeple
__label__unhelpful this game is so much fun i have a blast playing it love the look and all the different however ! the crashing it crashes a lot is there solution if not can you get an update that fixes it quick sometimes it crashes right after starting other times just randomly itll crash and i have to reopen than that its the only problem other than that love the game fix the crashing itll be a five !
__label__helpful i dislike that the shotguns are literally snipers , and how overpriced skinsemotes etc . are but the game is addicting also please stop finishing me right when my teammate is attacking you tryhards .
__label__unhelpful for being such a simple , small sized game not to mention two updates in . it is still not very good . ( playing on xb <num> x & google fiber isp) i get booted from at least <num> out of every <num> games and most of the time its more thsn once per game . clunky aiming for a non aim assist game . frames per second still drop significantly . grenade physics . overall it feels like im playing a ps <num> game .
__label__unhelpful i really am excited for the better together update and i want it now it has so man cool things i just saw a beta version and please release it early !
__label__helpful this is the most unbalanced piece of ever to exist . kirby battle royale or minecraft hunger games would honestly be a better choise at this point .
__label__helpful wish a <num> star review as an option . why ? because this bootleg of pubg is overrated overplayed trash . love microtranactions that are overpriced ? love unbalenced and broken weapons ? love terrible building system ? love a toxic fanbase ? then this game definitely for you and the rest of their retarded community . who doesnt like seeing it everywhere on youtube , mixer , twitch etc ? who doesnt like amazing youtubers and streamers going from pumping out beautiful content to only posting and streaming fortnite ? every person who said no then congratulations ! your one of the rare people who isnt a fortnit crackhead and if you said yes theres something called rehab . and me and all the sane people who said yes , strongly recommend it for you . and breaking news as of writing this review ive ust received a fortnite looking for group post . this is what i mean . its everywhere <num> .
__label__helpful it is fun but i cant play save the world anymore because whenever i go on it it says to claim the rewards for a mission but when click on it it says that i cant cause a deferral key is active and when i click continue it just sends me back to claim the rewards and into an endless loop .
__label__unhelpful the game keeps giving me an hour wait time before i get to play bullsht
__label__unhelpful i just waited <num> minutes . to say it failed then it wants me to wait another <num> no way in hell is that happening fix the game or better yet stop f it up . well i waited again and now it says <num> min
__label__helpful i think the game is fine . it is basically the pocket version (i dont mind that) and im starting to see a connection between this and xbox , which is cool . however , twentysix dollars for this when the actual pc version is twentysix , console is twenty and pocket is ten is just bad pricing . all the other versions are well priced by what features you get . the pc version has mods , xbox version is on xbox , and pocket edition is portable . this is on the same platform as the pc with way less features . it is not worth twentysix dollars . it should be more like ten .
__label__unhelpful i just got the ultimate deluxe edition and it wont even let me play now
__label__helpful do you watch rick and morty ? if so , this game is not for you . this game is directed for the high school sports ball players , i . e . the intellectually challenged . battle royale mode is clearly plagiarised from pubgs avantgarde game designs , which gets its inspiration from gambling . statistically , the odds of winning a game of battle royale is the same as getting a doctorate from harvard a more prestigious and respectable achievement . the cartoony art style displays its immature appeal . furthermore , the character designs show off how well epic games can objectify women . a pure luckbased experience to cash out on the battle royale craze . the save the world story mode features unimaginative situations . it started out with an interesting premise . a mysterious outbreak has taken over the world , and you team up with a crew of wacky robots to drive them back . and then nothing happens . youre running the same missions ad nauseam , and landscapes are all the same with no sense of progression .
__label__unhelpful <num> . <num> update brings in the much anticipated end dimension with all of the features from javas <num> . <num> end , however , it continues to lack features such as dual wielding and weapon nerf and buffs from <num> . <num>
__label__helpful i am having the same issue as alishia . really like playing the game , however just a couple of days after purchasing the full version , and playing it almost constantly ; it suddenly decided yesterday that i didnt have the full version . now it will only pull up trial version . please fix or refund my money . the game is fun and addictive .
__label__unhelpful very epic indeed and lots of ⚔⚔⚔⚔ but it crashes sometimes <emoji>
__label__helpful i love the combat pubg offers . theres none of that instant fortress stuff like fortnite . while i may find myself saying how ! or yeah right ! most of the time its due to my own fault . its a massive learning curve , but once you adapt . you become an efficient fighting machine . graphically , its more realistic . although textures on older consoles look blurry more often , and the inventory screen has no character . i do enjoy that i can explore most buildings . and audio is accurate for weapon shots , etc . although its hard to hear footsteps unless you turn volume high on headphones . my biggest complaint is the loot and mts . you will get the same pair of shoes , <num> + times . your motivation to play , is hopes of something good for once . but now , in a game you already paid for . you have paid event passes like fortnite . unlike fortnite , you cant earn gpoints for playing . so you will have to buy the pass , or be stuck with the basic free rewards . its fun , just needs better rewards
__label__unhelpful thats all there is to be said
__label__helpful i opened it yesterday but , the options play etc menu wasnt there , i opened it again today , same thing , please help me with this ? i really wanna continue playing it , or if you could help me in some other way like this if you cant change it maybe let me know if it saves your mapsgames skins and everything , if the game does save all that stuff when you uninstall it and reinstall it , if not please tell me what else i can do to fix it , thank you
__label__helpful <num> damage with shot gun point blank <num> times this game blows
__label__helpful i enjoy the game because its a break from traditional shooters looking for realistic gameplay . i believe with an optional competitive mode this game could create a lasting name for it self . dont listen to the pubg hate . both are good games
__label__helpful trash servers trash gameplay terrible game . <num> still a pos
__label__unhelpful gives me the trial unless i open through ms store . not always connected to the internet so this is a problem , please fix .
__label__unhelpful the guns are so inconsistent , i cant build sometimes and if i can they can somehow shoot through it . building noises do not occur sometimes . when i first land and pick up a gun it acts as if im holding an invisible pick axe , very good game <emoji>
__label__helpful i love the tactical realism ! i agree there should be a friendly fire option but then that would take away from the reality of the game . spawn killing is a big problem especially with seasoned players . i say just change the timer that they cannot go outside for a few seconds after the prep phase is over so attackers can get out of the spawn at least . all around great game .
__label__unhelpful kinda smooth gameplay but inventory management is the worst thing ive ever seen . get over the hype . save your money and play fortnite .
__label__helpful super laggy , controls are so difficult , fortnite is free and id rather pay <num> dollars for that
__label__helpful i have had this game since it came out . i fell in love with it immediately . nearly every part of the game perfect . then , the game started feeding its money from skins and season passes . that was really the beginning of the end . epic started adding stupid and unnecessary items , rather than fix any of the game breaking bugs and exploits . seems like theyre worried more about making skins more than anything else . lets not forget the unbelievable skill gap , network connection (which used to be perfect) , and the unnecessary amount of items . the amount of items in this game come pretty close to the amount of experiencable issues as well . its a shame to see how far this game has gone downhill .
__label__unhelpful why fully release the game its still broken , i love firing <num> rounds from a <num> to see in spectator mode only a quarter of his health is gone .
__label__helpful i love this game so much . i play this game everyday . the only thing i dont like is i get match making errors every <num> games . other than that its a great game <emoji> . also im updating riggt now i wish us console players be able <num> lean without aiming . still i love the game but if ubisoft could add that would be great .
__label__helpful rubberbanding is an issue again . crashing is an issue again . the texture issues are back . waiting for stairs and houses to load (not there or made of playdoh) is extremely frustrating , and so is having to back out to ready up . please fix these experience killing issues . it feels worse than day one . (xbox one s)
__label__helpful minecraft is a really great game . you can build and explore . you change your skin anytime too . updates are awesome and will always make the game even beter than before . i hope you like it . one thing that is also great is that you can play with friends . are you ready for it ?
__label__unhelpful well first off i just want to say i love this game ever since the fortnightmares update there hasnt been almost any lag . second of all fnbr is not in beta if you were to buy early access to the save the world your game would still be titled fnbr im not sure why though . all i know is fnbr is not in beta and it doesnt have much yet but its an amazing game . <num>
__label__unhelpful it definitely was a great game , up until everyone bought the season <num> pass . now they wasted money for absolutely nothing . its really sad when they canceldelay the dlc for season <num> after everyone bought the passes . its a complete scam , id love a refund , but we all know that wont happen . recommend the game . however do not buy the season passes you will not get anything for season <num> pass !
__label__helpful the game is going to be buggy its the way game preview works quit crying you are either bad at the game or dont know what game preview means .
__label__helpful this is a great game and im glad to see it come to console , but needs serious connection work .
__label__unhelpful didnt get season <num> pass i paid for
__label__helpful if you like getting shot by your squad . this is the game for you . toxic players abound . do not waste your money .
__label__helpful i love this game . on my xbox . but why isnt it available on the pc ? i just wanna know
__label__helpful the game is great the crafting is easy the combat isnt hard to figure out and theres alot of weapons and character the graphics are great and overal a great game
__label__unhelpful i bought this version expecting everything from the java edition but i was totally wrong . this version doesnt support any other servers , mods , or addons . it ridiculous and its the same price as the java edition . if i were you id buy the java edition because it comes with the windows <num> edition for free . also if you were wondering you dont get the java edition for free when you buy this which is so incredulously ridiculous i cant even begin to type about it or id get so pissed i might die .
__label__unhelpful do not get ! from the reviews i could figure out it is basically pe version but on a computer . it also costs a lot more .
__label__helpful not <num> sec where you are not lagging . graphics hurt to look at . controls not mappable . inventory controls take so long to navigate you might as well just kill yourself before someone beats you to it . people who say it just released , give them time to fix everything can not be reasoned with and should be sterilized . this game was meant for pc , and as much as i wanted it to work on xbox , it doest .
__label__helpful this is awsome it relaxes your brain if your mad its a creative game i love it ! keep it up mojang and i love this game i rated it <num> stars i just love mojangs work into this keep it up mojang
__label__helpful the game is good , but its fing ridiculous how many times ive been team killed . not to mention how im currently banned for <num> hours for defending myself from a team killer , and if thats not bad enough i cant get the ban lifted . please fix this problem
__label__helpful great change of pace . got so tired of the fastpaced shooters that take zero teamwork or strategy . this game is built upon those two aspects and its fantastic . ubisoft knows whats up .
__label__helpful i like the graphics in the water . excellent sound . color is beautiful . it s a good game for someone like myself who is disabled . it passes time by everyday and night . im glad its available as a free version as well . i hope to buy the full version so i can play with others .
__label__helpful takes time to get good but very enjoyable .
__label__unhelpful this game was so much fun when i first got it ! i even purchased the $ <num> version . three days layer they appear tp have created a queue ! this was my go to game . now i wont touch it . <num> minute queue just to play is not okay ! i feel cheated at the highest level . if they remedy this i eill rate <num> star sincerely , destro
__label__unhelpful i like the new fresh graphics thats it . its okay for beginners but really ? this is pocket edition guys ! dont buy it , if you have a mojang account go for it and get ready to be mind blown !
__label__unhelpful the crashing and lag are very bad , every time . you pay <num> dollars and the game isnt even worth free this is very poor ! p . s . in squad it has taken my brothers and i <num> min . and <num> sec . no button for <num> people to play instead of <num> crazy wait to get a game even going just to lag out this is nuts , if it doesnt get better soon i will have to contact the bbb feel ripped off here . this game is also on pc crazy how you can put out a game so bad with the lag and kicking out of the game and call it good , crazy to do this to anyone . have to say the <num> squad much better addition is great , since the last up date , but still the lagging out of games is the worst part of this game poor !
__label__unhelpful i paid <num> bucks for it .
__label__helpful i really love this game but it needs to be available on pc !
__label__helpful i love minecraft but for some reason my windows <num> store is not letting me download the update its frustrating but i hope it gets fixed soon , either microsoft or minecraft , if you have found this problem as well just run updates on your computer and then restart it should click into place when that is done and allow you to play and update the windows store to better your game
__label__helpful siege used to be a lotta fun during the first season , then the updates started rolling out . game breaking bugs frequently occurred . it was chaos . many glitches have been patched , but many are still riddled throughout the game . i rated <num> stars and not <num> because i cant go <num> game without a failure for a headshot to register . let alone the blue screen glitch and the constant disconnection issues in ranked . please fix this game and please buff tachanka .
__label__unhelpful play area moves too fast !
__label__unhelpful i have been playing this for a pretty long time now and let me tell you , this game is awesome ! <num> players , last one standing wins ! even if you dont like the game , its free so you might as well try it . i love that you are able to build in battles , or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win . i also like the storm slowly going over the map , pushing in all the remaining players to one small area . i also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find . from rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge ! i also like the stuff that you can get loot from . you can get loot from hot air balloons , from the ground , or you can get loot from golden chests ! i most of all love the extra modes that they add in . my favorite is playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want ! what i dont really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get . overall , i think you should get it !
__label__helpful just add the refund system back maybe allow <num> use only
__label__helpful i cant hear footsteps anymore , so i die instantly
__label__helpful its great with friends these negative comments are just trolling a good game
__label__helpful i sometimes play minecraft pe with my friends , but since the androidioswindows phone version is not easy to play , i rarely use it on my phone . now i can play with my friends , on my pc , even though they are on a mobile phone , and be at <num> fps and beat others on pvp because im using a mouse ! : d . <num> . this is minecraft pe ported to pc , and i love it : ) ★★★★★ out of ★★★★★
__label__unhelpful purchased day one of the free weed and as of today havent been able to connect at all . the best i get are the situations and there offline love to know if the problem is on my end but have yet . to find a solution either in forums or from ubisoft support . paid for offline situations . great game ubi .
__label__helpful i been playing this for over a year now . i love the texture packs and mashups . i would love to see a five nights at freddys mashup . i know thats just wishful thinking but it would be awesome if they did .
__label__helpful first off , this game is free for anyone who owns the pc version of minecraft so youre going to download it anyway . its good now . play this version for vanilla mc
__label__unhelpful this game will never die <emoji>
__label__helpful limmiting building materials , updating to appeal to new players only not old , day <num> player here and used to play every day but quit due to people who build so fast now a days i literally cant play for fun i allways have to try my hardest and it used to be perfect but now the games popularity has began the downfall of fortnite . i can build really fast but the people who are better than me are the toxic people that say im just bad . this toxic community defends fortnite with their lives and are blinded by the choices epic is going forword with .
__label__helpful i love this game . very fun and most importantly very free <emoji>
__label__unhelpful if you are sick of going outside and trying to build a castle but it just falls apart go get minecraft the full version it is so fun you get to show your creative side and you can play all day and join peoples worlds aka your friends worlds and you can kill stuff plus there is no blood well redstone kind of looks like blood but its not and for adults just let your kids show their creative side and a little secret for the adults , your children will listen more if you say do your hores thennnnn you will be able to play that game you like that people call minecraft and for me i did do my chores and guess what i gots to play well for us kids thats how we like it well kind of well i will only say a little bit more and for that little bit more it is that if parents dont want to deal with their kids just put em in front of minecraft and they will be blessed to see it and they will be glade they saw it well my good friend thank you for reading and taking the time to read my beautiful review .
__label__helpful ive been playing since season one and it got better in season <num> and <num> but then they started to go downhill . more debuffs and buffs start coming along with glitches . the rpg radius was debuffed making it more likely not to hit anyone even on direct contact . then shotguns were debuffed making it more likely to do <num> damage to a player with a pump or tact . then c <num> s were buffed making it be able to destroy half a building in tilted . then the shopping cart glitch and the walking through walls glitch happened . then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ars and other guns . fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a victory royale . <num> or <num> vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more money . i hope u found this useful .
__label__unhelpful i cant wait for this game . but i really hope you put in . difficulty modes . to make the game really hard .
__label__unhelpful it a really good game and i recommend it but some thing just dont make sense like the hit boxes are out rages and i shoot someone so many time they dont die they shoot me like three time with a pistol and i die and when i jump they shoot under me and still does damage like ok and mostly every thing about it . suuuuuck fixxxxx it the game is garbage pubg is better you game freaking sucks dude so i suggest you fix the game for the thousandth time
__label__helpful its fun with friends but epic . needs to stop adding and start fixing
