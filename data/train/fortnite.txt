__label__unhelpful__very epic indeed and lots of ⚔⚔⚔⚔ but it crashes sometimes <emoji>
__label__helpful__been waiting for this forever <emoji>
__label__helpful__fortnite's pve has decent rewards and a player can earn legendary guns and v bucks which are quite useful for many purposes pve sadly is quite buggy at high level missions and many newcomers will ask and beg for free items which can be rather annoying fortnite pvp lately has been focused on their greed for money (tragic) constantly releasing cosmetics and skins instead of addressing lag crashing and horrible gun imbalances is rather sad epic games just another large game company taking advantage of kids w their parents credit card i recommend far cry <num> battlefield <num> or star wars bf <num> not p <num> p and rather enjoyable warning : if you don't sweat extremely hard every single match until you have a stroke fortnite battle royale is not for you i hope my detailed review was useful to you best of luck ! updated : double pump is back pretty much why ! no skill to this game at all just build spam or hide play something else honestly go outside maybe
__label__unhelpful__get an ar and shoot someone in the back all other guns are pea shooters stealth not included
__label__helpful__looks like a turtle took a and shoved it in a vagina
__label__helpful__it would be better if they did more but thats impossible because tons of youtubers are playing this game and not talking about any of the problems
__label__helpful__it's all about if you drop in and get the pump at the startor else youll get blasted by it bc no gun not even the scar can beat it within <num> m onestly i've given up on the hope for them ever maaking this game fair bc it keeps getting worse
__label__helpful__it made my pee pee hard
__label__helpful__its fine but the lag ruins the whole game
__label__unhelpful__stupid game no wonder it is free
__label__unhelpful__the guns are so inconsistent i can't build sometimes and if i can they can somehow shoot through it building noises do not occur sometimes when i first land and pick up a gun it acts as if im holding an invisible pick axe very good game <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__dis game gave me de diabetes ! i dont like dat ! it has des trash skins and dey like be costing like <num> dollar ! i could get ur mum for an hour for dat ! anyway ! i hope u lik mah knowledge ! ill be dabing on ze haters <emoji> i have one of those litboi
__label__unhelpful__this game is nothing but a poor attempt to copy pubg in a cartoonish fashion that needs to stop to give pu the rights to this type of game that means take this game off xbl and sue epic
__label__unhelpful__all u do is defend an atlas and this guys van its terrible and doesnt deserve <num> whatsoever
__label__helpful__rendering video boundry connection team mate all new issues but hey got new flowers and ac unit in windows just another garbage game now
__label__helpful__honestly game was fun earlier but this game has so many bugs and they dont even fix them now its the worst game i've ever played
__label__unhelpful__trash physics doesn't work at all this game is retarded
__label__unhelpful__they need to stop updating battle royalefake pubg and start working on save the world
__label__unhelpful__battle royale is just another lame pvp that only and i mean only rewards couch potatoes if you're lucky enough to have some intelligent squad mates you can still get jumped by someone who can snipe you with a shotgun from several blocks away (not kidding) the pve story mode is ok progression is slow but fun the crafting and leveling systems are likely to drive anyone up a wall they're so unnecessarily complicated (doubt they'll ever fix that either but oh well) if you have the patience pve is worth the money battle royale is not (and its free)
__label__unhelpful__incredibly disappointed in the bofa in every match save your time and just play skyrim
__label__helpful__i enjoy game with the little amount of friends i have
__label__helpful__i really like the game i have been here since season <num> but i have one problem xbox doesnt have free skins like ps <num> so xbox needs free skins in fortnite
__label__unhelpful__anyone who says this game is boring doesnt have enough intelligence to completely rock this game it's not just tower defend missions this game has more game modes than overwatch each map load contains different terrain which gives some really interesting defend builds this keeps you on your crafting toes if you play just five hours than you still haven't learned everything yet honestly you were probably in the tutorial but you thought you were playing the game i completed chapter <num> which is huge and get rewarded with more game types makes me wonder if there will be even more to come to truly challenge the player on final chapter
__label__helpful__pros : simple quick matches building and those spicy astetics cons : weapon grades needs more traps it also needs to expand areas and it needs to fix hit registration fyi : to all who say fortnite copied pubg i just want you to know pubg copied h <num> z <num> so now you know shut up with that nonsense opinion : overall the game is fun and free so why not give it a try it has it's issues just like any other game but if you compare it to pubg they both have similar issues except fortnite is free pubg is $ <num>
__label__helpful__the game's shooting mechanics take no skill as the shotgun is so inconsistent and ar bullets don't go where they are supposed to go the only decent part about this game that takes some skill is sniping the game also takes so long to switch and equip weapons and the servers kick you out for no reason this game needs to be fixed by ''epic games'' until then i will never admit it to being even a ''decent'' game <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__it's not everything the internet hypes it to be if this isn't your cup of tea then don't play it
__label__unhelpful__epic games does not know how to handle a game everything is unbalanced and stuff that needs to be nerfed gets buffed and everything that needs to be buffed gets nerfed and this game is mostly on luck not skill
__label__unhelpful__the amount of tryhards in this game makes it impossible to play for casuals or noobs like me but it is possible to have fun however there is one thing wrong they lock cool visual upgrades behind the battle passvbucks microtransactions if you can'twon't buy them they will send annoying emails telling you to buy it
__label__unhelpful__hopefully we would see playeruknown's battleground soon ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__well first off i just want to say i love this game ever since the fortnightmare's update there hasnt been almost any lag second of all fnbr is not in beta if you were to buy early access to the save the world your game would still be titled fnbr i'm not sure why though all i know is fnbr is not in beta and it doesnt have much yet but its an amazing game <num>
__label__unhelpful__this game will never die <emoji>
__label__helpful__(let me just point out this is my first review for a video game)i feel like everyone's hating this well made game (in my opinion anyway)part of it you'll notice alot of these reviews are written by alot of younger people and some also don't make any senseothers say it's too hardand others just don't like it which is completely finebut that's what i think is half of itok enough of that let's get on with the reviewi'll start out with the only flaw in my opinion it can lag alot it could be my internet thoughi had a time when i was in the top <num> (or something like that)and i got teleported to my roof of my base and died <emoji> some complain about vbucks being too expensive(which buy emojis dance moves skins etc) but grant no competitive advantageso it really is a free gamei'm running out of letters so i got to short this upon with the good stuff <num> no pay to win game <num> fun to play <num> its sweet to play against <num> playersbut only one winnerthanks for reading my opinion <emoji> ✌
__label__unhelpful__you can see the improvements keep it up !
__label__unhelpful__thats all there is to be said
__label__unhelpful__this game is not very good it is rng its mostly wandering not very original and is boring oh yeah never has a sharp metal object been so pitiful the games positives are occasionally being fun it is satisfying to win and you have nothing to lose cause its free oh yeah i lag less in call of duty wwii
__label__helpful__so the thing that ruins the game the most is the fact you don't gain anything for winning or getting a kill mostly vbucks not only that the save the world game mode was said to be free by <num> but we are half way into <num> and it still costs money basically false advertising right there
__label__unhelpful__this is battle front <num> on steriods and its way trashier
__label__helpful__this game breaks every week they don't care about fixing this game for console it's been over a month since building broke and they've done nothing don't worry though this game on pc got fixed right away
__label__helpful__make a <num> v <num>
__label__helpful__these are my favorite types of games if you are into shooter freeroam games this is for you
__label__helpful__your game is no wonder it gives people anger problems just take it down from the store
__label__helpful__so we dont earnv coins and it glith alot dont wast your time download it
__label__unhelpful__this game was designed for brads and chads
__label__unhelpful__take the new minigun out its not even fair when using it against others bases this game is trash how do you hit someone thats right in front of you for <num> health with a green pump ("the best gun it the game")
__label__helpful__this is a paid closed beta but nowhere in the description does it mention this don't waste your money
__label__helpful__slowly making the game worse with every update
__label__unhelpful__you know that one dead bug in your screen door that you try to ignore thats fortnite
__label__unhelpful__there is no way to learn to play if you are allowed to be killed as soon as you hit the ground how about giving time to find a weapon or creating a tutorial
__label__helpful__havnt been this excited for a game in a while !
__label__helpful__pvp battle royale mode : i've noticed some people complaining about fortnight's br vs pubg's br and i wanted to explain a few points <num> fortnight's br is far better at this point at fixing problems and bringing updates out while pubg has a harder time at it <num> fortnights br is focused on building mechanics while pubg is more focused on vehicles meaning more drive by shootings <num> fortnights br has a smaller map and because of that you get more action while pubg has a larger map meaning less action <num> fortnights br although cartoony has better graphics in the long haul then pubgs more realistic style <num> fortnights br gliders are more fun and useful then pubgs not so well done parachutes <num> fortnights br weapons are simple pick up and shoot weapons while pubgs weapons are reasonably complex with lots of different attachments and fire rate modes <num> fortnight br is free while pubg costs $ <num> both are fun just depends on your play style
__label__helpful__why can't we earn coins if we win a match or get to a certain level ? that'd give people a reason to play more
__label__helpful__shotgun are not as in s <num> specifically the pump you can shoot some in the head <num> and body shot for <num> and you cant even finish people when their down you cant even finish them it shows the hitmarker but no damage
__label__helpful__love the game but there are still many issues in need of tlc first playing with friends is a joke if you are <num> level difference forget about being social to progress through the levels after the initial <num> hours play time requires either money spent on "vbucks" or a lot of in game time not suprising since this game will be free to play in the near future but still frustrating ( <num> hours for one tech node at level <num> [obviously i'm not their yet but i did the math]) all that being saidgreat game
__label__helpful__like pubg but you know its free
__label__unhelpful__this game is so bad that is a ripoff of pubg one game i got tea baged this is a hateful game
__label__helpful__it is surely a game that will keep you interested throughout the time you play always keeping you on your toes with thoughts of where you will get shot at from next it is definitely a game that is worth a shot ! <num> !
__label__helpful__i went ahead and bought the $ <num> version of the game to play with <num> friends plus me and had planned to have a great experience with building fortresses shooting zombies playing with friends and gathering lots of loot the first <num> weeks felt like it was all going to be worth it but after all the repetitive gameplay and lack of worthwhile rewards i pulled the final straw when they deleted my castle which i had <num> pieces left a place on the map and now i have <num> stacks of stone sitting in my bank reminding me that all the <num> hours of work i put in to my castle of solitude was for nothing don't come to this game if you're looking for a creative outlet and some fun gameplay that will last you more than a week
__label__unhelpful__so the people of india can't play fortnite on xbox ? common xbox and epic games i bought the console to play fortnite you guys ruined all the excitement it's a great game and i am not getting to play it since i live in india i hope you will fix this problem
__label__unhelpful__it may be just like pubg but i think its better <emoji> the cartoon look is amazing <emoji> ‍ <emoji> but not only that because they keep updates regularly so you always have something to look forward to <emoji> they also added building and i think the building is one of the best things about this game the game is still in beta so its fine with some glitching they just need to make it less luck base <emoji> but other than that great game epic games one of the greatest games so far ⚔
__label__unhelpful__this game sucks so much i hope the creators die by a gunshot to there ugly mf face pubg is gonna kill this cartoonish game dont play this game its filled with degenerate nerds who have big gay
__label__helpful__horrible lag on decent connection unplayable no issues with other games
__label__helpful__i purchased this game twice once on xbox and once on pc i signed into my epic games account on booth but was unable to play on pc i contacted support got on their forums posted multiple times <num> emails so far first they ignored me then they started sending me excuses instead of making it right the excuse you have to make a new account that is not linked to xbox in order to play fine i can do that but wait you still can't play because it was purchased on another account ok so give be a code for a new copy that i can play nope more excuses and saying i have to buy it a third time they keep blaming xbox instead of making it right horrible support and bad business ethics
__label__unhelpful__its a good game but they have a lot of fixing to do a shot gun to the face up close should be a instant kill not <num> damage especially if they have <num> sheld and heath you have to shoot somebody in the head <num> times with a shotgun if they have <num> sheld and health witch is completely retar if your lucky its <num> shots and there dead other wise if they kill you and you see there heath most likey they have <num> health or lower i dont know about you but when you shoot somebody in the head it should be an instant kill not <num> shots to the head with a shotgun later
__label__unhelpful__everytime i start the game it crashes
__label__unhelpful__ive been wating for this game forever and it finally came out !
__label__helpful__i had thoughts of commiting pubg before i got this spectacular game but then i realized life is worth living after playing a couple rounds the graphics are so realistic and the way the game has complete noobs going up against pros is so fair and balanced i also love the variety all <num> of this game's maps are breathtaking i have spent <num> dollars on this masterpiece but have yet to place in the top <num> i have spent so much time and money on this art that i have been evicted from my apartment i am writing this review from the welfare line i accidentally ate all <num> of my children because i thought they were chicken nuggets and this game helped me through those tough times my wife left me because of my love for this game and i got a roblox girlfriend the next day thank you fortnite for saving my life !
__label__helpful__the best game in bugs
__label__unhelpful__does you're game have negative to ok reviews ? no problem ! instead of working on the base game so every mission doesn't feel the same just try to capitalize on pubg's popularity <num> for fortnite <num> for battle royale
__label__helpful__it was fun but now the screen wont fit
__label__unhelpful__i'm stoked ever since e <num> <num> showed gameplay
__label__unhelpful__fortnite is what you get if you combined pubg world style and combat with minecrafts fun building and overwatch's skins except fortnite manages to make it all suck i know its my opinion but i don't believe this game deserves all the praise it got and is still getting
__label__helpful__this pvp is garbage weapon damage is completely broken weapon color means nothing every shotgun will one hit kill you unless you are the one shooting at least pubg has a damage table that doesn't change
__label__unhelpful__i can't wait for this game but i really hope you put in difficulty modes to make the game really hard
__label__unhelpful__they said we would be getting new content on a set date and then had to push it back cuz it was not ready well i already took the day off and canceled my other plans dont give us set dates unless you are <num> ready to do it on that date and when you lie to us reward us if ark lies to us they give double exp for a while and apologize i deal with the crashes at the last minute of a hour long mission and then when i get back in i get little or no rewards for the mission i deal with the pay as the only way to get good things p <num> w i do not like being lied to and then not rewarded we didnt force you to give us the date update jan so i paid <num> plus dollars for this game and now i am forced to wait <num> mins to log in queue because they let a whole bunch of pvpers have the game for free i am a paying customer i shouldn't have to wait in line with the people who got it free
__label__helpful__its great if you just wanna chill out and pass time
__label__unhelpful__love the fact that you can shoot threw wood how fun
__label__unhelpful__ok the loading screen takes forever to load it takes <num> : <num> go load thats longer than gta v ok now the lag like i havd really good wifi and i still lag its really bad lag like really bad ive died so much times of lag that its unbelieveable but anythin else the game is fine
__label__helpful__i love the look and the borderlands feel i think they should add split screen though overall its awesome also its only <num> dollar for the regular edition !
__label__helpful__founders get nothing but random loot crates it takes far too long to progress have a favorite class from the trailer ? be ready to grind for hours and hours before playing it find a cool gun ? be ready to grind to craft it enjoying your loot ? be ready to grind when it breaks no reason to pay $ <num> for a f <num> p grind
__label__unhelpful__the game requires you to listen to your surroundings and keep a watchful eye out for other players that wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for the amount of lag that comes with it preventing sniper shots sneak attacks fair firefights not to mention audio cuts that prevent you from hearing other players there is also some poor damage consistency where you could use the same weapon as another hit each other in the head but you'll be the one to die and he'll escape basically unharmed
__label__helpful__this game is the epitome of "gets old fast" oh and micro transactions nuff said
__label__unhelpful__i am not a fan i think its too much like pubg it also gets boring the only good part is the save the world and the cool loot lama
__label__helpful__fortnite sucks it is trash heck i agree it stinks hope this game dies it just suck
__label__helpful__i love this game and i can't wait for the jetpacks this is awesome i love this do you
__label__unhelpful__this game is for kids freeplay has little rewards building ruins combat get pubg for real strategic combat
__label__unhelpful__im sick of this where everytime i land somewhere i get killed because of lagit's not okand i don't know how you guys do itbut every season is worse than the last one
__label__unhelpful__edit : harry <num> x <num> & its other bf supreme gmb got triggered by my comment lmfao dude <emoji> proves my point all the more that this game just another pos that will be dead soon cause they over hype the crap out of it its just a quick buck for em like overwatch one thing dose alright everyones gotta make their ow n verson pretty much like that "can i copy your homework" meme fortnite : "can i copy your homework ? " h <num> z <num> pubg ect "yeah just change it so it doesn't look like you copied" free & still dead meme
__label__helpful__the only thing i hate is the dmg system either make it more realistic or keep the dmg equal for the gun you use very annoying where you shoot someone with a close shotgun <num> times and they don't die while they shoot you once with rifle and you die
__label__helpful__dude the lags are killing the game
__label__unhelpful__save the world is good but the battle royale is a waste of money and time
__label__helpful__wow what a pathetic trash kiddie game cant escape cheaters on any platform now with keyboard and mouse cant wait for this movement to die trash kids
__label__helpful__"heads up review of br only" i've seen lots of <num> star reviews for stupid reasons and <num> star reviews for just as pissy reasons so here we go ! cons to pros ! cons' toxic and childish fanbase bad balancing v <num> rgin bucks requires real money to many old glitches its ez to get in a match with tryhards or kid noobs pros ok weapons cool unlockables nice map not p <num> w overall fortnite is just bad the cons are bad and nothing is memorable <num>
__label__helpful__loot requires microtransactions <num> skill trees = unnecessarily complex systems detract from core gameplay which is fun but underdeveloped all "quests" are essentially the same
__label__unhelpful__frame drops in the beginning of every fight guns not balanced at all map is to small for <num> players and seems like gun fights are random if you win or not i will just hold out for pubg to drop
__label__unhelpful__this game was running fine until just recently on the pve side literally just lost all my inventory and ability to build stuff the game lags every <num> seconds every new daylag new player joins lag swarm of zombies lag giving players xp boostlag this game is a grinder it used to be fun for me but now its just unplayable
__label__unhelpful__its just a bad ripoff of pubg
__label__helpful__waited <num> min in queue just so it could fail on me over & over not bad enough there are many ppl having to wait <num> min and still cant logg in i wish i could give this <num> stars i regret ever having heard of this game dont believe the hype i want my money back !
__label__helpful__very disappointed ! they removed the jiggles from the calamite's hoocas (brest) now my peepee doesn't get hard now now i have to go on po hub to watch minecraft lets plays
__label__unhelpful__one of the best games out ! foget about pubg fortnite willl change that trust
__label__unhelpful__where are the free meme skins ?
__label__unhelpful__anyone who plays fortnite is a <num> yr old little kid
__label__helpful__review of battle royale and save the world fortnite has two game modes a paid pve save the world and a free <num> player pvp battle royale i will refer to the modes as stw and br in this review although i really don't like this game i will still give an honest unbias review to start off stw is more for a player with time to give while br is just something to play when your bored or for a player who just wants pure action i really don't like how epic games focuses primarily on the br game mode for example all of the screenshots for the game is the br map another example is that they changed the whole game's name to "fortnite battle royale" stw deserves more attention considering br probably wouldn't exist if stw was never made the building feature creates a unique aspect of fortnite making it a very popular and competitive game for most ages overall epic games does a great job at keeping their game relevant with the weekly content updates and interesting map changes
__label__helpful__it keeps saying that there was an error signing in to xbox live is there anything i can do to fix it ? it's been like this for months update : i try to sign in n your website but it says that my account is inactive i tried signing in with a different account but then it says my xbox live account was already linked please tell me how to reactivate my account once you fix this i will give a <num> star rating until then you are stuck with <num> star please fix it
__label__helpful__pump headshot does <num> <emoji>
__label__helpful__epic please try adding bots for no fill playground mode please thank you
__label__unhelpful__it is so fun i do not want pubg to sue epic games if they do will we get are money back and i want epic games to updating the game because it is so friken fun
__label__unhelpful__fortnite is laggier than subnautica i get that its a big game and there are gonna be bugs but the lag is unbearable if you get to a building and you get a gun you might encounter another player that player might have a gun if you want to kill the player you will increase your chances of the kill if you fire first but if lag comes in you might lose the lag is issued by player so it will hit you in short bursts
__label__helpful__be careful playing this game it's highly addictive my only problem is shotgun damage wish they were actually shot guns and not pea shooters
__label__unhelpful__give us everything for free
__label__helpful__i originally rated this ☀☀ but decided to change it after the respect for the developers epic games are absolutely amazing at conveying patch notes accountability and showing their sense of urgency this game has only got better and better it doesn't compare to pubg and that is the point all of the dummies saying they copied pubg are nieve the same could be said for any title does that mean there can only be <num> shooter <num> racing game(do not buy project cars <num> ) etc ? of course not ! gather a friend and play duos or grab up to <num> and play squad the game gets better and better as you do
__label__unhelpful__it should not need xboxlive like ps <num>
__label__unhelpful__waiting in loading qeue for <num> min
__label__helpful__this game is fun and a grind but mostly it's a buggy laggy glitchy mess not to mention they reset our "permanent" bases today without warning wait for free to play
__label__helpful__how am i supposed to play if i'm constantly rubberbanding and lagging all over the place ? this game is alright save the world's hombase storm defense blows i can atleast get in top <num> and then die from a guy camping in a housei literally tryhard but this game apparently all luck and a little skill so i lose in the most bs ways
__label__helpful__i love the gameplay but <num> its laggy and <num> theres major problems with installing and uinstalling save the world i accidentally uinstalled save the world and so i tried to install it back but my luck it just kept saying instllization stopping and it stopped at <num> and wouldent go up so i reset my xbox and i canceled my que but when i looked at my games fortnite wasant there so i went to my install tab and it said the whole game wasant installed to sum it if you try to installsave the world and u cancel que cause it dosent work it uinstalls the whole game :
__label__helpful__its fun but it had a specel feel when i started during christmas but it lost it whith season <num> and the glitches also building used tobe simpler so ya
__label__helpful__the battle royale can die in a fire i rather play the simpsons wrestling on ps <num> !
__label__unhelpful__i am autistic but i still like this game
__label__unhelpful__i got this game because pubg was laggy and full of desync i had heard better about this game thats all wrong if you're looking for battle royale just get pubg
__label__helpful__this is the worst battle royale game i ever played first reason is highly overrated not gonna say any names second reason the game is pay to look ugly and the skins are ridiculously prices and battle pass is not needed and last not certainly least the worst ripoff of pubg and minecraft both of these game are fun but not fortnite that's all i have to say if you read this rant do you agree ? also i prefer despacito for life then this mistake
__label__unhelpful__the game is complete trash poor player base and mechanics
__label__helpful__the game was fun at the start a way of competition to pubg you could say now its terrible its not fair in any way the community are just a bunch of very rude and immature kids who know nothing more this game is a pure example that games are not improving but getting worse i don't ever want to see this game again
__label__unhelpful__it's one of the best things i've ever played it's given me something to do on xbox since destiny <num> is dead btw this is better than destiny <num>
__label__unhelpful__cant wait for this game it looks amazing
__label__unhelpful__building is awesome gets updated frequently and new weapons every few weeks and amazing skins save the world is my vbucks giver takes time and practice to get skilled at the game and map gets updated not like pubg with no campain and like other shooters not like fortnite most played game i played and if you think overwatch is fun muselk played it and is playing fortnite pubg no good skins if you think mouse is best with speed you can change sensitivity
__label__helpful__now i have played other royale game like the culling and pubg but none compare to fortnite why ? well you jump out of a flying vehicle and land somewhere on a well thought out highly detailed island you stock up on loot and start killing other unfortunate players who crossed paths with you collect building materials so you can defend yourself and others if you play duos and squads with all this happening a huge barrier (the storm) closes in on all <num> players if you win you get a message saying <num> victory royale ! and the alltowellknown umbrella repeat ! i mainly like fortnite because of the strategy used when you die you can learn your mistakes like "i didnt build" or "i forgot crouching makes you accurate" really the only thing i dont like are fortnite trolls but those are rare that was my opinion i hope it helped !
__label__helpful__the game would rival pubg as a free game but laggy controlls the v buck cost way to much some guns are useless or sometimes for example riffles way to op the graphics are aa grade for a free game and the custom building is nice ! i do not like battle royale though maybe add in like a <num> v <num> tdm or <num> v <num> war mode the game is really just a battle royale and it has no incentive to win so stars its <num> until thats fixed or i will check out the pve when it is free then maybe it will deserve a <num> or <num> star i really wanted to give this a bad review but i have hope for this game it has constent updatesgood luck <emoji>
__label__helpful__is too random and is a pubg copy about <num> of the game is action most of it is loading and walking lol
__label__unhelpful__i had <num> armor and <num> health and died by <num> bullet to the chest
__label__helpful__this game is horrible it is just a game full of trolls and confusion never be friends with people who friends unless you know them !
__label__helpful__the game starts out fun with loads of characters skills weapons and the ability to build your own bases problem being that after about mission <num> you realize that you're going to be playing the same few missions over and over again to make small gains for loads of work which you'll want to bring friends with to play with you as every mission is incredibly boring but both of those qualities are a little more forgivable on a free to play model in addition as with every early access game it's really buggy and sometimes the connection becomes so unstable that it is unplayable this game is also bogged down by the f <num> p model of paying to progress and having good gear and equipment hidden behind loot boxes so the tl ; dr wait until it's free to play as the game is built as a free to play with all of the annoyances of that model in the paid version
__label__helpful__this game is fun but it is trash ! and dont go saying well your just bad cause thats not why ! i was in a <num> v <num> and i pulled out my pump and it was invisible ! which meant i couldnt shoot it ! im giving it <num> stars because this bug has been in the game for so long and they still havent fixed it ! instead they focus on more important things like squinty eyed in the loading screen background
__label__helpful__this game has the worse deaths than mw <num> you can put a whole clip into someone with them not taking damage and they can <num> shot you im not kidding one of the worst games ive ever played
__label__unhelpful__in response to sarcha <num> pubg is far better than fortnite if something is hard to be good at then it means you need skill to be good at it fortnite is easy because <num> of the players are middleschoolers who dont have anything better to do pubg is better than fortnite <emoji>
__label__helpful__game deserves a low rating its very overrated most of the positive reviews are by little kids who havent even started puberty and blindly support a mediocre game its only popular because it is free the people who dislike the game get attacked by these who think fortnite is the only game on the planet and immediately assume you are either bad or play pubg its annoying ! worst of all other games add br because they are begging for more players thats how fortnite became popular epic needed to save fortnite because not many people liked "save the world" so epic decided to sap off of pubg's success with br but this time making it free and advertising it to younger people thats how fortnite br became popular those younger people mindlessly defend fortnite with arguments like "you just havent gotten a win" or "you are just a salty pubg fan" or even " you you suck i hate you fortnite is the best game ever go kys" i might get bombarded with angry messages for this
__label__unhelpful__terrible lag and gun damage
__label__unhelpful__gameplay is fun when it works servers crash ever other day and when they are up your game lobby will crash <num> of the way through it is nice that when you log back in not all is lost no instead of the rewards earned you get a level <num> chest with booty in it so many times over it truly is a huge waste of time
__label__unhelpful__no gameplay variety at all !
__label__unhelpful__i hate this game the game is play to win people who have the battle pass always win which gives them the upper advantage over other players the in game store is so expensive $ <num> for a player pickaxe and glider skin don't get it because its really horrible
__label__unhelpful__this game is boring and based on luckit gets on my nerves you shoulda put out save the world firstyou developers need to work on stw more or this game will become pure ! im waiting (still) for save the world to be available for free for now <emoji> this game <emoji>
__label__helpful__thought i was buying done retail game not another early access gimick start screen saying closed beta was shocking constant crashes & lag super harsh durability is boring pay to play microtransactions as usual just wait for finished free version next year
__label__unhelpful__worst game i have ever played
__label__helpful__fix the shotguns and take out smgs
__label__helpful__unlike <num> of the reviews here i am going to try to give an actual review pvp is fun with friends but can be frustrating at times (but what games arn't ? ) there are some problems like odd hit detection and a very steep learning curve for a free to play game however (or partly free anyway) this is incredibly good i love the style of the game as well most games in this genre all want to be realistic but this one takes a chaotic cartoony approach that feels and plays very differently then the other games in the genre (for reference i have played h <num> z <num> and pubg) if you want a realistic experience then this is not the game for you otherwise i would recommend trying it out at least personally i enjoy the alternate game modes best like <num> v <num> i recommend playing with friends as playing alone can be boring at times oh and did i mention cross play ? i often play this game on pc with friends on xbox or mobile you can't play with psn players sadly
__label__unhelpful__i like the guns i dont like the glitch
__label__helpful__this game is takin over kids lives
__label__unhelpful__i don't even do reviews but they just obliterated pubg it's free now plays in <num> fps consistent updates and has a pve mode within the full game purchase i'm gladly giving this game <num> stars for how far they have come in a such short amount of time they fix bugs asap and actually deliver their product in a timely fashion my god i must say i am proud of you fortnite ! please keep up the good work these triple aaa companies need to learn from the little guys and actually deliver quality like this in reasonable quantities well done ! slow claps <emoji> download this and try it out you wont be disappointed with the latest update <num> <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__fix your broken game <num> damage headshots face to face with a rare pump shotgun you have to land at named areas to get good loot i feel your hitpoints for gun damage is randomized the graphics are decent cosmetics are ok overall gameplay is below average and the theme for season <num> is lame make <num> v <num> a standard game mode overall the game is pretty bad the servers are mw <num> has better servers than this game
__label__unhelpful__do not see the appeal of battle royal games all the cons of good games packed into one sht game better than pubg but thats not saying much maybe i just dont get it because i dont eat tide pods
__label__helpful__probably the most toxic game i've played the community is <num> x more toxic than the minecraft community when the better together update came out if you don't own a skin then your considered a noob which isn't right shotguns literally do <num> damage to the head while your enemy one taps you with <num> damage jetpacks make the player impossible to hit the lag is atrocious and needs to be fixed because people can shoot through walls when season <num> came the whole game began to fall apart but the developers dont care about the acual problems they only care about adding new skins and weapons so they can trick <num> year olds into stealing their mom's credit card so epic can fill up their wallet if you haven't installed this game dont it's not worth your time to download this awful game that leeched it's success from pubg
__label__helpful__obviously for poor white people and virgins
__label__helpful__please add split screen for multiplayer !
__label__helpful__i enjoy the game because its a break from traditional shooters looking for realistic gameplay i believe with an optional competitive mode this game could create a lasting name for it self dont listen to the pubg hate both are good games
__label__helpful__fortnite is a very enjoyable experience with friends your mileage may very depending on which version of the game you get and how much time your willing to put in it but the game has a terrible repetition factor that for people who want a variety of things to do in the game will be disappointed greatly like i was for those who are ok with this extreme repetition the games systems gameplay and over all structure is great (ha puns)
__label__unhelpful__well it got great but since they decided to go <num> fps its back to lagging not to mention they expect you to play as good as a pc player with new cross platform play try killing a pc player with the hardcore lag xbox just ruined the game now its not letting me enter the game pubg is a better i recommend it over this
__label__helpful__this game is amazing and freethe first day when i started playing it i didn't know that there was skins that you can buy a couple days later i knew that i needed to get a skin but instead of buying the skins i bought save the world deluxe edition so i can get vbucks everyday
__label__helpful__this games launch is a joke first of all however my biggest issue is the fact that no where in the description of the game that you buy is there a warning that this is infact a closed beta the game is in shambles as far as i can tell which would be fine if i had been givin a warning as to the fact that it is not a full game that will be release in the spring of <num> some of you may say i should have looked at game reviews but i should not have to use game reviews to find out if a game is prerelease or not overall just don't buy this microtransaction garbage
__label__helpful__it doesn't load and it say"pc or mac' over and over !
__label__unhelpful__you will almost spend more time updating than you will be playing because it is constantly needing updated ! now im almost out of data
__label__unhelpful__this game is so friggin dope ! but just fix the clicheness and the fact i never find people because of that stupid double t tilted towers ! (also add a huge hikingbased mountain place called hikin' haywire)
__label__unhelpful__i wanna love this game its so much fun but epic wtf this is such a poorly developed game it gives me the runs srsly stop adding and fix this game plz for the love of gods honestly <num> star game from a <num> star company oh btw the game should run better after a maintenance and yet every time they "fix" something the game runs worse trash trash trash epic games can eat a well you get it
__label__unhelpful__i would say it's a nice game for kids since it's free but it promotes unrealistic violence ! if you play this please do us both a favor and block me because our mental state and capacity aren't on the same level chop some rocks to build yourself a fort let it be your tomb✌
__label__unhelpful__this game is overrated as the combat is and it ruined any chance of any new fps games having a good multiplayer
__label__helpful__its a really good gamemode and if u dnt have money for pubg boom battle royale
__label__unhelpful__this game has given me hours of fun and as a free game that's amazing it's good to have a game that all of my freinds can have easy access to and can play together feels like i'm back in hs when we use to all play games together more often with full cross platform i can finally play with all of my friends no matter what platform they are playing on thank you epic games !
__label__helpful__the title says it all then they dont get updates out when said about an hour ? naw more like <num> ill just stick to a good game like pubg while im at it ill stick on a better system as well which is my pc garbage
__label__unhelpful__i love this game but whenever me and my friend play and we are vs <num> more group we lag out the game or lag out and get killed and this isnt the first time i find it suspicious how this happens in the top <num> everytime and this has happened to friends also update : this game is a really good game devs always up to date slowly improving and i don't know why it has such bad ratings with a game that is very fun also dont complain its <num> free : )
__label__helpful__it is a watered down version of pubg
__label__unhelpful__this game is super addicting ! the graphics are perfect everything is great but many things : <num> lag it doesn't happen often but when it happens it fks up your whole game you can't shoot it freezes and the glitches are annoying <num> campaign isn't the greatest don't waste money on it <num> battlepass switches to early <num> party issues (disconnection errors lag etc) <num> <num> type of map <num> innacurate damage <num> vbucks are expensive (just like <num> k) <num> reloading is slow <num> people hack <num> uncustomizable weapons <num> servers are like <num> k <num> updates are to frequent <num> no firstperson option <num> no enemy signal <num> slurp juice shotguns and silenced pistols are overspawned <num> to cheezy not great elements used <num> no vehicles <num> not much modes <num> there should be an option for <num> or <num> people in a party <num> no customizablecreator skins
__label__unhelpful__this game is trash i could watch old people try to suck their toes and get better gameplay than this heaping pile of trash
__label__helpful__games community is toxic and weapons are unbalanced and i suggest paying for pubg because at least thats not toxic
__label__unhelpful__everyone is like talking a lot about this game everywhere and i can't wait to actually put my hands on such game and best of all it's free to play !
__label__helpful__i cant play one f°°°°°° match without lagging <num> i move one inch an get thrown around like a frickin rag doll would i recommend this game ? no it sucks more than a stripper on a dollar tuesday
__label__unhelpful__this game has a life season s <num> defaultss <num> tryhards and defaultss <num> defaults half tryhards end seasons <num> tryhardss <num> tryhards and meta guns s <num> ? in reality i just hope this game never exists and go normally life with other game now nobody touch or play other games and i hope s <num> is the last season ? cause this game cant live longer and thx for making and showing how this game grow from nobody knew to most popular game thank you epic realbuckedcave <num>
__label__helpful__the gameplay is fine i just do not like the obnoxious people that ruin fortnite itself <num> stars for the game <num> star for the players
__label__helpful__i don't like how i hit the guy with <num> bullets and he killed me
__label__helpful__i used to play the game till i realised how toxic a community of <num> year olds can be basically voice chat is ''double pump ! '' also ''hes hacking ! '' and ''your trash ! '' and dont get me started on the streamers cough cough ninja who do stupid things like the ''pompom'' what is a pom pom then lastly how they ruined there game by adding things like golfcarts and grocery carts
__label__helpful__this shouldn't be a game
__label__unhelpful__this game is the cancer of the internet and will just end up like minecraft did its unfun to new players trying to play the game and other platforms have unfair advantages due to mobile haveing the option to see sound and pc has quicker aim it the most unfun game i have ever played and its just going to get worst even <num> year olds are playing the game might as well get the hole minecraft comunity over here then this game is cancer and is going to burn i can already see it now aus fandoms under age players every were so go ahead go play a game that you cant even play because a player is going to kill you before you even start and the game has already started to generate dank memes and and if you did win good for you your another loser without a life
__label__unhelpful__with minimum microtransactions consistent updates fortnite is free to play if you chose but skill gap is a problem personally but practice makes perfect
__label__unhelpful__best free game on the market pubg runs terrible and is boring give this a try with friends and have fun
__label__helpful__this stupid game ruins friendships all my friends only play this stupi game and when they say they'll play they just keep playing forever and never do anything else this game is stupid
__label__helpful__the best part of the game is the building aspect if this game didn't have building it would be like any other survival game keep up the astonishing work <emoji>
__label__helpful__fortnite takes a lot of popular mechanics and makes a game out of them zombies ? check horde mode ? check lots of loot ? check crafting and base building ? check tower defense ? check rpg style skills trees ? double check it's not short lf it's flaws however game crashes more often than i would like i can see the missions getting repetative and there is a slight lean towards pay to win but if you enjoy grinding for loot and buildingdefending bases than this is the game for you
__label__unhelpful__alway makes me wait an hour to <num> mins an rips me off when i bought the sarter pack only gave me <num> v bucks not <num> v bucks and always kicks me out of game
__label__unhelpful__this game was so much fun when i first got it ! i even purchased the $ <num> version three days layer they appear tp have created a queue ! this was my go to game now i wont touch it <num> minute queue just to play is not okay ! i feel cheated at the highest level if they remedy this i eill rate <num> star sincerely destro
__label__helpful__with the game still in beta $ <num> is the only buy the game is fun but over hyped also the more i played the game the more i enjoyed it the game has some good qualitys like a huge skill tree and depth in squads an character building an actual building at the same time feels like it was all wasted when you get into the game itself the quest rotate every few hrs or so same quest just different locations they throw in daily challenges trials to help but are still played on these same maps its not till levels <num> when you first see new locations in the game they do add a few new enemies as you progress just with all that depht the gameplay itself falls short filled with repetition an a lot of grinding with drops that you don't need an looking for the ones u do need for crafting you basically replay the same maps over & over again just rotated the campaign is just that with breaks of objectives that need to be done on these same maps just rotated locations an mixed in
__label__helpful__i don't understand how this game is popular i would rather rail my great grandfather with my cock than play this
__label__unhelpful__why do people not like this game
__label__helpful__i love this game ! it cured my cancer <emoji> !
__label__unhelpful__pubg killed this game so it dumped this unplayable clone for free avoidwait for the real thing
__label__unhelpful__the game has cheaters and bots don't play or you will lose money like me i lost <num> dollars i wanna to give to a friendly player but when i died to this bot player <num> i had <num> cent left i hate this gamei want my <num> dollars and my game fixed
__label__unhelpful__you play stupid game get nothing but stupid rank also stupid is little kids begging thier parents to buy stupid costumes and stupid emotes stupid game its just stupid too many updates
__label__unhelpful__fortnite used to be a good game ever since fortnite blew up epic got so greedy and started to focus on money and cosmetics over players they stopped caring about the players a long time ago and yet people still play it <num> and the whole lucktowin factor is just to get more appeal from trash players so that they'll play and buy items fortnite is just a moneygrab now
__label__unhelpful__i like the game it is cool
__label__helpful__i lovee this game but i wish save the world was free <emoji>
__label__helpful__it cured my cancer and depression but then it gave me more depression then it cured my depression but then i developed cancer on all my body parts i watched everry anime in history and it cured my cancer but then john wick gave my depression back the end
__label__helpful__i hate the lag because it's getting me killed
__label__helpful__i loved this game until season <num> before it was a great game and was fun but now it is full of <num> year olds who call you a noob if you don't have a $ <num> skin now all my friends play fortnite and i am the only one who hates it
__label__unhelpful__im about to win but then it lags me off my teams building and i get shot by the enamy team
__label__unhelpful__(edit : gameroffaith <num> pls read carefully b <num> u send me comments again nowhere in this rant did i say fortnight stole the battle royale genre from pubg pubg didnt invent that genre h <num> z <num> did) drop in spawn eye of the storm ? pubg u just gonna let a rich company that came up with the unreal engine and gears of war screw u by dropping their game first on console and for free loaded with microtransactions ? lawsuit is surely needed for those <num> yr old to <num> yr olds who force there parents to support this free to play garbage f'off this is a careless ripoff of what pubg has founded not the battle royale genre but the drop in spawn and the forced movement of the eye of the storm sad to see a rich huge company like epic games result to stealing ideas from at the time a indie company but sadder to see people back this stealing from a much smaller francise ! this cant be supported by gamers u r helping a rich company fattin their pockets by screwing the little guy <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__second updatestill cant log in after <num> weeks of owning nor can the servers access my purchased content i cant believe i paid for ths game stay away ! ive had this game since launch and this is the second time i havent been able to play a game that i paid a lot of money for ! this is not good seems like their servers are constantly down it wont log me into my epic account despite the fact ive already played this game a few times this is garbage
__label__unhelpful__all this game is is a big money grab it makes it free but makes it so that youll play it but makes it so that youll have to spend real money to get better things and this game is built on that along with that this game has no original ideas and relys heavly on mirotransactions to thee point where you will spend lost of mony on this
__label__unhelpful__this game is trash get pubg instead
__label__helpful__everytime i try to play it it just crashes it doesn't even start
__label__helpful__it is a real shame of the new view i can only see half my screen
__label__unhelpful__so what this god damn game is telling me is that could have <num> hp and <num> sheild and the other can have <num> hp if i shoot him with a scar ith all my ammo they dont die and if they shoot me once with a lil pump i die this game needs another update and if you make it even worse im uninstalling <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__fun <num> of the time <emoji>
__label__helpful__ive got an extra standard edition if someone wants it
__label__helpful__the game requires no skill you literally just point at who you want to kill and boom theyre dead look out for those kids who spam walls everywhere because theyre too scared for a gun fight my <num> year old cousin has won solo many times because he only knows the two buttons to win this game the aim button and the shoot button atleast pubg requires skill and patience its fair in every gun fight and people actually have to fight for their lives this game ? no you just have to tear down a bunch of houses and get a scar and boom instant win leave this game for little kids shoukd really put a maximum age limit of <num> on the game
__label__unhelpful__the game in itself is good but it gets <num> much credit the game has lag issues plus the whole game is <num> luck based there's not much skill when someone has a purple ar that ends u in <num> shot compared <num> a green peashooter ar that takes <num> headshots <num> gun somebody down plus the mapchest weapon drops r <num> consistent in some areas there r plenty of skilled players in the game but almost everyone knows where the best loot chest r on the map it makes the game <num> uneven plus this game is a squeaker paradise <emoji>
__label__helpful__this game is a laggy broken mess fix it and if anyone is even thinking about playing this dont
__label__helpful__could do with less lag
__label__unhelpful__f this game str <num> up game is wack
__label__unhelpful__theres no skill involved with this game you can spend <num> minutes looting then get sniped by someone who only has a shotgun even though you put put all your shots into them
__label__unhelpful__before you mark this unhelpful let me explain this is the most laggy game i have ever played the lag is worse than cod running off of mcdonald's wifi also you could find the best assualt rifle in a matter of minutes or it could take you ten minutes to just to find a pistol my point is this game has way to many luck factors in it and please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions if you fixed the game like this i would give the game four out of five stars update jan <num> still garbage the game has gotten much worse the silenced pistol is way overpowered you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone also shotguns are still overpowered lower their damage i tryed pubg and at least that game has balanced health and weapon damage plus there are no shield potions to be found in pubg update jan <num> lag is fixed so heres <num> stars shotguns are still way overpowered i have no more room left so <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__i cant get in on pc
__label__unhelpful__dont like the dab or that fact of friendships being destroyed ? how could epic games go from gears to this trash ?
__label__helpful__this game currently is the definition of a pay to win (progress) game it got horrible roll rates even when buying llamas you'll get crap or dupes upgrading doesn't change rarity if you want a certain character you better be lucky or willing to drop alot of money no good rewards the collection bonus gives a good reward at <num> then nothing till <num> then <num> really ? crashing alot excepted of a beta but you have to pay to play right now which doesn't really make it a beta beta are tests this is a full buggy game that they charging you for and calling it a beta well this is early access well tone down buggy and up the rewards so far the game got a good concept but it lacks the reward
__label__helpful__this game copied pubg and is starting to call every dance "the fortnite dance"
__label__helpful__i dont enjoy the fact all the people who paid for the founders pack got kicked asside by stupid free battle royal i feel betrayed and i will no longer be purchasing or supporting content from epic games
__label__helpful__this is not a finished game it is paid early access it should be listed in the game preview program yet both microsoft and epic are more than willing to lie to you about what your buying save your money for it's free to play launch next year !
__label__helpful__it is nice but we should not have to pay for gold to play this game
__label__unhelpful__good game but servers are horrible
__label__unhelpful__i used to hate this game a lot when it first came out but know i'm liking the game i'm happy i gave it a second chance i play this on pc it's better but xbox it's okay i have played three seasons <num> <num> and <num> and i have gotten better and it's really fun i love the changes that they made it make the game better and i do regret hating the game i would had the skull trooper and dark knight <num> being a great game
__label__helpful__i dont like how you cant download fortnite on a computer plz change this
__label__helpful__first off i did not hate this game entirety just that you know just dropped the base game into apit of fire
__label__unhelpful__was bouta get a dub with my boi clerf he disconnected for no reason later the game building does not work at i died frick fortnite
__label__helpful__the game constantly freezes and lags when in combat and by the time your screen unfreezes you have already been killed and looted weapons are incredibly unbalanced and give players a huge unfair advantage (hand cannon and basically any legendary) absolute trash just man up and cough up the$ <num> for pubg on steam you lazy cheapskates even the xbox one port is better than this mistake
__label__helpful__it is fun and not too challenging for the normal missions however the storm sheild missions are nearly impossible alone and it is a real grind to get the materials needed for defenses defenders and bullets it just really needs solo balance but besides that it is a great game
__label__unhelpful__dis game doo doo nah jk love it keep it up epic
__label__unhelpful__i just waited <num> minutes to say it failed then it wants me to wait another <num> no way in hell is that happening fix the game or better yet stop f it up well i waited again and now it says <num> min
__label__unhelpful__best game ever all you haters are just trash at the game
__label__unhelpful__the aiming system is horrible
__label__helpful__it doesent let me play !
__label__helpful__take the cartoony monsters of pvz add in the epic weapons and feel of borderlands and throw in the crafting open world feel of <num> days ; and you get this action packed thrill of a game !
__label__unhelpful__so i rush a kid with double green pump and each of my shots do <num> damage and all headshots especially the lag makes it worse
__label__helpful__epicgames claims the game is "fair" that is until you unload an entire shotgun in someone and they just shoot you with a pistol once the amount of bs this game pours out is bad enough in addition they cant even make their own emotes but rather copy dances and gestures i'd recommend pubg if you are looking for a game that has significantly less lag bs cheaters and server problems server problems happening all the time as in about five times a month on top of that it takes hours or days to get through a login queue just to have it fail and wait again if you plan to buy the game if you haven't already save your money the game is too broken
__label__helpful__epic we dont need more guns we need better servers to handle your growing number of players
__label__unhelpful__i like theres a thing were u make yur own base and thats it
__label__unhelpful__really epic yesterday i was soo excited ill today i go online and my battle pass is gone if u can do it for me my account is jaleel swag boy all caps no numbers
__label__unhelpful__this game is the best ! <emoji> but their are some mistakes but this game is very addicting
__label__helpful__fortnite should have a turtorial onto how to play this gameand the sad part isis that people will hunt noobs just for a free kill and if your not tryharding then forget about winning you'll die from unbalnce weapons you should have levelskills based matchmaking so dont download unless you want to get an brand new tv because you broke your tv
__label__unhelpful__but i cant seem to figure out how this is supposed to be 'fun'
__label__unhelpful__this game is amazing and i really dont see any bugs the shotguns do less damage than they used to but that is good because u havee to work for a kill the only bad thing is how muchh vbucks cost which is for cosmetics so it is not pay to win
__label__unhelpful__was able to play one game of battle royal then i quit out to watch youtube then flash forward <num> hours and i launch the game then <num> windows pop up a were loading fortnite please wait then it says cant download uninstall something else then try again which is really frustrating as i have <num> gb free and the game itself has been installeddeleted many times as well as other stuff(gamesapps) but same experience every time fix this problem please
__label__helpful__this game was good now there are so many overwhelming updates that the game is getting the gunss are unbalened and every one has to rely on two shotguns epic games if you are reading this please listen
__label__helpful__building mechanic is awesome ! simple flexible and fun you can use it to build forts before the wave comes or like a defensive weapon in the heat of combat the part of the game not in the videos is a deep mathcard collection game like a rpg with <num> unique character models so far firstperson perspective option (wo weapon animation) and large level areas with very welldone procedural generation downside ? needs a toggle for firstperson this game is an awesome snazzy zombie survival version of star trek online's mathcard game
__label__unhelpful__you get to kill people and i dont like it you die
__label__helpful__this game is bs because of you all damn sweaty tryhards get good at the game you garbage players also fix pump dropoff i'm also an og player ( been playing since season <num> )
__label__helpful__wish a <num> star review as an option why ? because this bootleg of pubg is overrated overplayed trash love microtranactions that are overpriced ? love unbalenced and broken weapons ? love terrible building system ? love a toxic fanbase ? then this game definitely for you and the rest of their retarded community who doesn't like seeing it everywhere on youtube mixer twitch etc ? who doesn't like amazing youtubers and streamers going from pumping out beautiful content to only posting and streaming fortnite ? every person who said no then congratulations ! your one of the rare people who isn't a fortnit crackhead and if you said yes theres something called rehab and me and all the sane people who said yes strongly recommend it for you and breaking news as of writing this review i've ust received a fortnite looking for group post this is what i mean its everywhere <num>
__label__unhelpful__i did all this work just to get the game to see why my friends like it so much but i cant even access it on my laptop ridiculous
__label__helpful__you just do the same thing over and over again it would be good to make a sandbox mode without the objectives
__label__helpful__its just like comparing marvel vs dc halo vs cod apple vs samsung dont compare the amount of similarities judge the game by itself then compare the quality of the game with another knowing that making different battle royal type games is hard to accomplish fortnite did make different mechanics and resulting playstyles the quality of these mechanics are not the best but i prefer fortnites playstyle compared to pubg
__label__helpful__its a amazing game ! but fix the severs because i cant get in my game to see season <num> <emoji>
__label__helpful__i love this game very fun and most importantly very free <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__great shooting i love unlimited sprint cool crafting mechanics single ques duos and team ques although some lagfps hiccups & some minor bugs imo this is the best battle royale on consoles rn <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__every time i have to deal with people that don't use their brains it's not even funny when you only get teamed up with people that hardly use it or even use their eyes or ears are you in there that feel ? but something only i don't like is that ? i have to put all the time
__label__helpful__this game used to be so great now it's a piece of crap the shotguns are beyond broken the damage will go from <num> to <num> in the end you'll just get killed by a submachine gun when you get a good shot off with your shotgun they nerfed building nerfed shotguns and buffed smgs epic is trash and refuses to listen to any of their community we all want good and balanced gameplay and epic decides to add in "thanking the bus driver" fortnite was in its prime in season <num> from then on it has strayed further and further from what it was epic just needs to fix their game they finally did something right and then they screwed it up
__label__helpful__fortnite is the most autistic game it inverted my penis
__label__unhelpful__i have been playing since the first day and i still get on fortnite every day people don't understand that they are hating on a free to play game and complaining about the current metta <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__fortnite is the hottest game out but there are a few problems with this game for example pumps does <num> damage up close and they also should fix the lagging problem other than that this is a really good game <emoji>
__label__helpful__one of the most fun games i've ever played wonderful community for example i needed some coal to finish a gun and its very hard for me to find and some guy just gave me some also i love the fact that you can pay the difference and upgrade to the more expensive versions without buying the game again
__label__helpful__just wondering when my velvet couch is going to arrive i ordered it off this site about <num> weeks ago and yet nothing has shownup at my door the problem is that i plan on giving it to my uncle who is in an iron lung but his anorexic son keeps rubbing my virgin olive oil all over my current furnishings if this doesnt arrive by next week my downs lesbian daughter (aka slave) will get her peyton mannings rubbed by a jew who supports nazi germany much love leprosy boiz (ps where my hitler at doe ? )
__label__helpful__this last update made the lag worse than it was before needs fixed asap
__label__helpful__its too fast and raided by <num> year olds
__label__unhelpful__bait n switch with paid loot early access is new marketing speak for paying to beta test wait for the actual release and save your money never again epic <emoji> holy crap what happened to the tower defense we paid for ?
__label__helpful__
__label__unhelpful__how about you start charging for the game so you dont waste your time with your servers and spend more time making the game good
__label__unhelpful__only fun part is gliding around in the glider at the beginning looking at the view of the pretty island chopping trees is cool and all to until somebody with a stupid gamertag ruins it all by shooting me its i am going back to farmville to grow plants in peace
__label__unhelpful__i am not going to talk about how the game is broken because we all know that but when is save the world gonna be free ? and why do outfits cost <num> to <num> dollars ? i feel like it is just because they want more money for a ripoff of pubg fun for a while but gets boring rpg is op shooting through walls is a new update <num> star
__label__unhelpful__i don't like the fact you require xbox live to play on ps <num> you only require internet microsoft is trying to be greedy and make more money (not like they don't have billions)
__label__unhelpful__such a bad game it gave me cancer
__label__helpful__this game is really just an awesome game only one thing split screen there needs to be a local co op then <num> star
__label__unhelpful__i hate playing the game by myself because every time i get either double triple or quad teamed in solo ! it is so inferiating ! and if you are a starting player it does not care the game will put you up against no lives ! other than that good quality gameplay and graphics
__label__unhelpful__kid cartoon trash the boogie bomb need i say more i play big boy games with my big boy pants on if you think your good at pvp because of this game thats really sad
__label__unhelpful__they said that on <num> save the will be for free but its a lie
__label__helpful__just so you know the shotguns need to be nerfed this game ruined <num> friendships
__label__helpful__the game is fun at first but if you even get the slightest hint of competition you'll only get mad at the game meaning it'll turn into a game you think you're having fun at but are really putting yourself in hours of repeated pain
__label__helpful__fornite is falling apart the game use to be fun now its boring and stale shotguns are useless because smgs are op plus the game is nerfing the thing that makes it unique and that is building along with countless bugs and lags epic fix your game
__label__unhelpful__servers have <num> minute que at times just to log in and thats just the volume from only preorder players sometimes after the que login fails and restarts que from the beginning ! framrates drop hard at times almost as if the game freezes missions are recycled after playing <num> hours i've only come across <num> or <num> different mission types overhyped and unpolished which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game
__label__unhelpful__your system doesnt find my live account
__label__helpful__im so tired of this game <num> percent is luck base you took it from pubg it lags and gliches i like the style but fix it please
__label__helpful__this game is trash it is a rip off for pubgit's art is bad the controls are ok but you can't o in first personthose are the major complaintsemotes are boring except for a few new modes show the brokeness of the game because of balance issues for the people that get the event item i cannot recommend i want to try to give it a chance but i just can't if they fix these i would give it a chance but only if they fix themlag is also bad my friend lost games because of it
__label__helpful__out of <num> games some bug limits gameplay (invisible guns not able to pick anything up some areas not even allowing me in etc) in <num> of them the other one booted me off for no reason at all edit : the game is somewhat fixed but still trash every game in every region is so boring because everyone lands at tryhard towers even ones you do meet desperately build at any range thinking they look good when in reality they can't get a single kill weapon balancing you kidding me ? a full clip of a blue pistol won't kill but one shot of a gray tac does one last : items $ <num> for a cosmetic skin ? that's robbery overrated garbage pass on this one
__label__unhelpful__when i land in a desserted place i get killed from no where plus this game sucks and playerunknown's battleground is better
__label__helpful__terrible not fun a laggy mess ! no fun shotguns nerfed too much ; zero damage pointblank ranged ; just not fun no more games ruined season <num> c <num> too op ! fix or i quit
__label__helpful__make save the world free
__label__unhelpful__i hate ths game ! dont install it ! play playerunkowns battlegrounds
__label__helpful__i personally enjoy this game the gameplay is great besides the major lag that needs fixed i mean those really negative reviews out there are not needed rating this magnificent game a <num> or <num> is not needed a <num> or <num> fits it better i would recommend this game to others if they can handle lag spikes but this game has really good potentially it just needs a minor cleaning of things
__label__helpful__ok so this games damage system is bad when im in point blank range with a tac shotgun i should do high damage but thats not the case i just got done with a match and i had <num> health and a green tac shotty and my enemy had <num> and a ar and i get a headshot and did <num> damage and got raped
__label__unhelpful__the game has little lag and you can tell the creators love their game but even still its the developers seem to want to cater to new players shotguns were nerfed so that beginers wouldnt be killed as fast materials are even harder to collect so that players dont have to worry about enemies outbuilding them c <num> is very powerfull so that if you are getting outbuilt you can knock it all down and reset the playing field smg's were buffed so that if you arent accurate at all you could still spray and prayllamas were nerfed severely so that materials are harder to come byrockets were removed from llamas and capped so that if you were a slow builder you didnt need to worry about an endless barage of rockets and according to rummors there is going to be a materials cap so that expert builders cant do as much they are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side showbut its not all bad knewsyou can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of <num> $
__label__unhelpful__a broken game shotgun dmgs glitch and do <num> dmg and loot system is broken
__label__helpful__not for the casual player who just wants to play a game after a long day of work if you're a try hard with too much free time then this is the game for you pubg has an overall better rating and its broken and cost $ <num> that should tell you all you need to know about fortnite
__label__unhelpful__keeps logging me out in the middle of matches this game is trash
__label__unhelpful__the best battle royale game ever pubg sucks and fortnite rules <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__the game is just a remake of pubg just animated and obliderated every other good game in existance and all people talk about
__label__unhelpful__put aside the bugs glitches and lag ts a great game i love playing this with my friends even if <num> of the time we lose all of the <num> year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop as this game deserves at least <num> stars the shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know as well as some other serious problems like stw scammers and lag if you are under <num> years of age you probably shouldn't play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some <num> year old tryhard so for the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are <num> or older try to not think about the glitches and other cons and just have fun i also highly recommend buying save the world but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed great game <num> stars from me
__label__helpful__secretly they use bloom for a gun fights which means it is more luck based not skill based
__label__helpful__like : the fact that i'm still alive dislike : the fact i played it
__label__helpful__update : the game is getting better give it a try if you're interested ! still has a long way to go though <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__i wish they did not add rocket launcher because people use them alot and it does alot of damage sometimes my game lags when people kill me with a rocket launcher <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__i love the game i just want save the world for free
__label__helpful__this is the fifth time writing this so its going to be breif now this isn't written to hate on the game this is actually one of my favorite games im writing this in hope epic games will see it the grid system is really messed up if im trying to build a wall i don't want it to be place in the groud or below whatever im standing on also the lag i don't know if its the game or my internet but everyones complaining about it so i assume its the game please fix it if possible that all the issues i have with the game another thing please read comments not ratings when seeing if something is worth getting ive seen people ive the game a one star because there were to many tryhards its pathetic seeing how salty people have caused an amazing game to have a two star rating overall
__label__unhelpful__i dont like the tier system and it sucks and the coomunity are justt trolls and just the whole game !
__label__helpful__so you want to buyplay a good battle royale game ? well this is not the game for you "welcome to fortnite battle royale a game such like pubg we might be getting sued for it we have <num> of a kind weapons like the pumpshotgun it has <num> damage per shot but it only does <num> close range we have the brecciwait i mean the semiauto shotgun its supposed to do less damage than the pump but lets just say with this weapon who needs a sniper that brings us to the snipers specifically the semi and the bolt each bullet you shoot has a faster drop rate than your prom dates the theres the rifles the burst and the full auto each one is terrible in its own way the burst has the spray of a pornstar and the full auto hits like a pea shooter then the submachine gun oh and its direct retarded cousin the tacticle version both are just god awful like god wouldn't use these to kill people he'd use the revolver which has the best accuracy so in general just wait for pubg not this"
__label__helpful__man i love player unknowns battle gr i mean fortnite !
__label__unhelpful__walk around a map for <num> minutes only to have the "strom" or someone camping in a corner kill you gameplay wise the aiming is awful guns are inaccurate loot system is completely messed i do not understand why this game is popular
__label__helpful__ps <num> and xb <num> can now cross play
__label__helpful__the fact that people hype this game as much as they do means that the human race is doomed the community is really freakin' toxic consider how 'bout half the world spend their lives on this game and put that together with their toxicity and you will understand this dire situation
__label__helpful__i like the cosmetics and understand why they cost money but what i dont understand is why people rage that you have to pay for them its not like it gives you any advantage that make people think that you might put up a good fight and people dont look at the fact yha their cool but epic needs some way of getting money to pay the people who contantly work on the game trying to make it better so player can play but you need to fix your shotguns epic
__label__unhelpful__this game gives me sleep paralysis from boredom its the same process over and over
__label__helpful__save the world give itinsted of giving us ne guns in battle royal give us save the world for free plz !
__label__helpful__im only putting <num> stars becuase ps <num> gets cool free stuff and we dont if we dont get any thing i will delete fortnite
__label__helpful__i hate this game doesent deserve to be popular online open your eyes the games bad game deserves to die
__label__unhelpful__game is fun for <num> day then its just me landing and dying do not waste time to download also the only way to get vbucks is to pay for them which is over priced or pay a stupid amount for an add on save the world game abselute crap
__label__helpful__its a good game but i hate that you have to pay for skins how about unlocking skins or skins in pve who agrees ?
__label__helpful__any fan of crafting building and defense games would love this ! would definetly recommend this game ! looks great and plays very well ! two thumbs up <emoji> and a <num> star rating well deserved for a great fun title like this one ! am really enjoying the game definetly worth paying $ <num> for <emoji> does not disappoint
__label__helpful__most over rated game in the world !
__label__unhelpful__played for about <num> hours and i'm already bored missions are to easy zombie things wont hit you if you walk side to side and the constant freeze frame foor three seconds then coming back to getting hit is weak glad i only wasted <num> bucks not impressed at all
__label__helpful__i sold my wife and daughter for wifi and vbucks best game ever ps gave every one thats come to my house ligma also if you think you can clap my cheeks you better sleep with one eye open
__label__helpful__had this happens while playing missions white delivering the bomb and you can't actually find objectives because there not on the map we literally destroyed everything on the map and then the game removed us because we ran out of time because the objective where nowhere to be found
__label__unhelpful__purchased wont load since month <num> support wont help if needed ! calling for a refund today <num> smh i was so excited to play too
__label__helpful__okay fortnite needs an update the game kinda sucks ! for example when you build something you or an enemy sometimes can go through it ! it's horrible when you're trying to have a build battle with someone there is not many benefits so you suck epic ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__although an unorigonal idea still much enjoyable your first win feels amazing btw <emoji> <emoji> ⚔⚔⚔⚔ <emoji> <emoji> ♻
__label__unhelpful__it was advertised as an open world survival fort builder but its not its a mission based defence game where you constantly run out of ammo and farm materials for about <num> minutes before you start a mission so if you are looking to throw away <num> dollars and waste a large amount of time this is the game for you
__label__helpful__they market the game as though its a complete game but really all you are paying for is access to the beta of a game that will eventually be f <num> p other than that the game is heavily grindingmicrotransaction based the gameplay takes place in missions rather than the open world one would expect from this genre of game meaning nearly everything you make each mission is gone upon completion
__label__helpful__tthis game was worth the wait hell my friend got me this and game sharing wit my gf we are having a blast even if its not fully open world this a builders
__label__unhelpful__the crafting part of the game is ridiculous and is not needed and the game looks like a cartoon ! you shoot someone and all of a sudden thier building a huge and tall fort ! i don't get it !
__label__unhelpful__i like winnning i also like the <num> percent accuracy also you only hate it because your trash
__label__helpful__this game is crap you will be in the last minute of whatever you are doing and it just freezes and boots you loved the game when it first came out then they did crap updates and fixed nothing dont buy wait till its free for a freeze game !
__label__unhelpful__i always get double triple quad or quint
__label__unhelpful__completely awful hit detection and imbalanced weapons provides no unlockable content or reason to continue to play
__label__helpful__i had issues but the game is awesome now
__label__helpful__my issues here really aren't much with the game itself game has a cool visual style to it i'm a big fan of the ability to just build fortifications when where and how you want some mechanics take a little getting used to but not the worst learning curve i've encountered no my issues begin and end with the fact that they are selling a closed beta to a free to play game for $ <num> basically what they are selling you is $ <num> worth of ingame purchases and you are paying them to beta test their game for them it's a kickstarter campaign marketed as a full game this brings me to what really bothers me and it is that in none of their marketing did they make clear that this is only a beta nor were they upfront about this being destined for freetoplay status even on this page that fact is barley a footnote i would probably feel different if they had been more transparent about what this really is or they didn't charge a full $ <num> again not a horrible game but not worth the fee
__label__helpful__how am i supposed to get <num> chest from wailing woods if the game dosen't guarantee the one chest that spawns their and fight between the other <num> people who land in a microscopic hut again <num> times the games trash don't get me started on the lag or how people manage to pull out their glider right as they land or how people shoot through <num> different walls while im trying to heal or how gernades from grease grove reach me from tiled thx epic fix your game or the challenge choose
__label__helpful__here is a rundown of he typical fortnite game you first chose whether you want to have fun or get a victory royal (play aggressive or passive) and then get over the fact that <num> of the playerbase will make hackusations if you win with a default character on another note the useless microtransactions are strong in this game im sure we've all learned by now that cosmetics = skill right ? anyway after effortessly clearing the drop area its only a matter of time untill someone snipes you from halfway aross the circle and you sit there wondering why this game is so popular or die as soon as you land thinking the same damn thing and winning is just boring you sit in the circle and waitforeveruntill there are <num> people in a space ⅓ the size of an american football field and pick them off with some random legendary weapon all in all fortnite isn't terrible just mediocre dont waste any of your <num> tb worth of space on it
__label__helpful__i would've given for fortnite <num> stars but it has good game play but it's way too luck based it has way too much which isn't a game it's very hard to win when there's so many glitches were you can't shoot the gun and where you fall to your death after usinsing your glider also it's annoying when somebody shoots a door kills you while it's the door and go through it and kills you
__label__unhelpful__updated <num> start of april ( <num> months after release) now and it still gets <num> stars they just keep adding more stuff to the game that no one wants and has no use they should be fixing prior issues and problems not adding more come on the gun play is getting better but still just rushers with shotguns <num> of the time all these rifles and never a chance to use them lol they also continue to mess up the game every update they put out <num> step forward <num> steps back they clearly want money with their overpriced cosmetics i mean seriously $ <num> $ <num> for just <num> skin ! wow if epic put more time into solving game issues and not pumping out battle passes and overpriced skins then maybe ill give them more stars untill then nope
__label__unhelpful__the battlepass was not worth it
__label__helpful__in the beginning this was a fun and entertaining game but now it seems like a social standard like as if your not good enough at fortnite your not cool or popular it’s really just overhyped and once you get it even if you don’t like it you feel as if you need to buy the battlepass and all the other things just to fit in good thing i put this game down real fast !
__label__unhelpful__hi my fortnite don't work
__label__unhelpful__no incentives for winning microtransaction city for cosmetics play pubg unless your hard up for battle royal with rng aiming
__label__helpful__this game sux all the little kids get horny for it <num> would not beat my meat over
__label__helpful__i cant get it on my xbox life on my laptop i need help
__label__unhelpful__this is worse than infinite warfare do i have to say more !
__label__helpful__an absolute visual representation of cancer <num> should be removed from space and time <emoji>
__label__helpful__you can't even play the game without running into a tryhard who no lifes the game everyday <num> hours a day my friends use to play different games and talk about actual stuff now it's just "i need to get a new cosmetic before my mom grounds me for getting v bucks with her debit card" people non stop play this game to the point where the game isn't fun anymore they still play it thought to show they can win the only real objective is to win and get cosmetics i mean the lag is horrible there are sweaty people left and right the game is pretty much pointless and it is taking away the chance to do other things now it's just fortnite this is what this generation has come to just warning you if you get sucked in by this game you're not getting out save the world is ok but everything else sucks
__label__helpful__good but i wis i could play with ps <num> players
__label__helpful__this is fun but expensive they should drop the price to half of what it is now
__label__helpful__buying any version of this does not at this time mean you will be able to play many who have bought physical and digital copies are locked out of their accounts and are told to rebuy what they have already purchased codes that are included in physical copies are not properly redeeming myself aswell as many others havnt been able to play for <num> days buyers beware ! i would post this review on the version i purchased but it doesnt reconize that i own it game support takes <num> hrs to respond and has been no help
__label__unhelpful__were do i start ? this game is garbage riddled with microtransactions and dosnt even say anywere on the xbox version that its going to be free to play in a couple months tutorial is about <num> hours long yes hours its way too easy and building a fort is basically useless because you can just throw a couple walls up and be fine and you dont get your recources back at the end of the game not to mention it takes forever grinding for those recources do not buy this game it sucks and you will regret it
__label__helpful__i would pay $ <num> for this for the current pvp vehicles and a biggerenlarged map would be sweet in the future but this is still in beta state the devs said bigger maps are coming and they are working on a way for vehicles to fit in download this game ignore all the bad reviews if bugs are out they are quick to fix <num> quick updates in the past couple days and now it's running smoother than butter
__label__helpful__i didnt know i was paying to be an epicgames beta tester this game would be fun if it wasn't broken the constant crashing needs a fix asap if you're on the fence about this game here are some things you should know it's pay to win it's not finished and still very broken it comes out free to play next summer so save your money unless you want to be a beta tester as well
__label__unhelpful__how im finna get better if i get killed before i can practice ? add leagues
__label__helpful__on my xbox one it is awesome but when i searched "fortnite battle royale" on my computer in the microsoft store it said "you owe this app" and i went to start i did not see it do you think you can help ?
__label__helpful__just add the refund system back maybe allow <num> use only
__label__helpful__skill tree buggy pve side
__label__helpful__any game made by epic is epic at first then slowly dies a good example is the gears franchise and now this this game has so many unbalanced mechanics that its more rngspam based than skill based don't believe me find the compact smg (p <num> ) or anything automatic using small ammo new to the game or don't play enough ? great ! you'll run into more sweaty build god players who play this game almost <num> that you won't be able to learn the game because you'll be dying so much (hiding all game doesn't help either) oh and if you already know how to play great ! you'll have a boring build off of who can build faster than just height advantage the enemy player you like the skins and emotes ? pay $ <num> $ <num> for them each this game is popular because of streamersyoutubers possibly being paid by epic games to promote it btw if you didn't know fortnite br has made <num> billion dollars in a year so its very possible ; otherwise not many players would be playing this tl ; dr don't install !
__label__unhelpful__this game is one of the best games ive played in quite a while and its not even finished i genuinely cant wait for its full free release in <num>
__label__helpful__the more you add to the game the worse it gets shotguns are utter trash now and the game gets buggier
__label__unhelpful__it says save the world will be free in <num> but it's not wtf
__label__helpful__most inconsistent gun fights i've ever seen in a game ! sometimes shotguns do <num> damage a shot and sometimes they do literally less than <num> tactical shotguns do an average of <num> dmg wtf ? rifles can take <num> shots to kill ? subs take <num> shots ? rockets do less damage than a pump shotty headshot ? the cosmetics are awesome but i can't have fun playing a game with the worst gunfights than any game i've ever seen they focus on adding stuff to their game rather than balancing the game they already have for a third person shooter this game is embarrassingly bad make shotguns do hard damage not variety ars are painfully inaccurate i could rant about the cons of this game for hours whereas i can finish listing the pros in <num> minutes epic games i think i speak on behalf of your most disgruntled fans balance your gun fights this is just infuriating to watch and play <num> almost unplayable
__label__unhelpful__epic screwed up bringing back skull trooper updating this game so much who agrees fortnite is dieing remember the old days like they show in the trailer who misses when building wasnt your biggest concern and rember whe all of you who played in season <num> how there was tac sub grey pump purple tac now its whoever canget to that scar i remember my first win when i bush camped and got that snipe and ended someone with a green ar near dusty depot they need to stop adding crap and repair dust and brind back that smg you won your first game with over at moisty or how you <num> pumped a sqaud with a grey pump i say bring back the good days
__label__helpful__anywhere you go there's campers
__label__unhelpful__pubg is a way better game for pc fortnite is a <num> yo tryhard magnet pubg is way more realistic and dosent have <num> yos breaking controllers and spamming a to jump fortnite is sht
__label__helpful__i started this game about a week after season <num> started and instantly fell in love this game was amazing and fun in every aspect and then epic started listening to the season <num> and <num> noobs then next thing you know the shotguns are nerfed then gathering materials is nerfed and so is editing double shotty and wallstructure health they even increased bloom on most weapons ! then here comes the smg's this smg meta has torn apart the game more then anything and the fact that their is no double shotty to counter it is sad very sad building is what made this game unique and fun and it was just about the only skill gap in the game now it doesn't even matter how fast you build or who is the better builder it's about who has the better smg and who gets lucky with there bloom shots literally it's making games shorter because their is rarely any build fights anymore not to mention that shotguns are completely garbage now i am probably gonna start playing realm royale for now on
__label__unhelpful__think you could add any more confusing menus charts webs and currencies ? update <num> the introduction of the battle royale mode has considerably increased the playability of this game the original game playing against zombies is still crap
__label__unhelpful__this game requires no skill all luck back then we had games like mw <num> and mw <num> look what we're stuck with now i had more fun in <num> days playing blackout than in this minecraft generation game good job epic <emoji>
__label__helpful__great and fun shooter game with creative skins and emotes
__label__unhelpful__i have been playing this for a pretty long time now and let me tell you this game is awesome ! <num> players last one standing wins ! even if you don't like the game it's free so you might as well try it i love that you are able to build in battles or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win i also like the storm slowly going over the map pushing in all the remaining players to one small area i also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find from rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge ! i also like the stuff that you can get loot from you can get loot from hot air balloons from the ground or you can get loot from golden chests ! i most of all love the extra modes that they add in my favorite is playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want ! what i don't really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get overall i think you should get it !
__label__unhelpful__this game is for autistic babies with nothing to do but waste their college funds on nothing more but virtual trash so stop buying virgin bucks and get outside reminder it rips off the pubg
__label__helpful__limmiting building materials updating to appeal to new players only not old day <num> player here and used to play every day but quit due to people who build so fast now a days i literally cant play for fun i allways have to try my hardest and it used to be perfect but now the games popularity has began the downfall of fortnite i can build really fast but the people who are "better" than me are the toxic people that say im just bad this toxic community defends fortnite with their lives and are blinded by the choices epic is going forword with
__label__helpful__payed for stw not br yet br gets all the attention
__label__unhelpful__garbage also it's extremely pay <num> win so if you're gonna play free don't bother
__label__unhelpful__also it's to popular and overrated <emoji> agree <emoji> disagree
__label__helpful__the game is great the crafting is easy the combat isnt hard to figure out and theres alot of weapons and character the graphics are great and overal a great game
__label__helpful__i really love this game but it needs to be available on pc !
__label__helpful__you guys didnt put lot of effort in thiss people arehacking and you guys arent doin anything about it and need to make updates twice a week
__label__helpful__the game is awesome but crashes way too much when taking your squad into a mission and right after you complete one it's done it to me <num> times today <emoji> another thing that needs improvement is the inventory space instead of having stacked items that are limited to <num> it should be increased to a <num> or <num> and some epic and legendary weapons break a little to easily so if some mechanic could be put in place for that it would be good overall this game is good just needs a few tweaks here and there
__label__unhelpful__too many teleporting cheaters and invisible trapspoor game in general do not recommend
__label__helpful__love the game but since the recent i cant even play it the game will load up and get to the menu then the screen will just turn black out of nowhere and go back to my xbox home screen can yall fix it please ?
__label__unhelpful__i love this game every update adds better graphics and awesome weapons keep it up !
__label__helpful__great ed movie love strong kkk presense with blacks totured <emoji> my migos are including mowing lawns teacheskids that women cant vote good vorempreg to this every night with my paided for wifes of the <num> and a half <num>
__label__unhelpful__pubg reigns superior this game is for children
__label__helpful__the game is good if it doesn't crash which it doesn't for me and if it does well it's free so it's not like you wasted money on it also being bad at the game is not an excuse for making a bad review saying there's too many tryhards and unbalanced weapons
__label__unhelpful__but the people hating are playing the wrong mode pvp is trash
__label__helpful__i just preordered and it looks amazing ! im looking foward to this game i love survival games <emoji>
__label__helpful__seriously what epic has done to shotguns is sad all the little noob don't need to be spoonfed skill ! i haven't even hit over <num> with one of the strongest if not the strongest shotty in the game it's really pathetic on how epic has managed to somehow make shotguns one of the worst things to have with you you have a very small chance of getting a <num> shot or <num> with any shotty this new meta also ruins the point of building ou just constantly get lasered and shot down by horrible players with smgs plus in squads almost every team are sweats with loads of smgs (good luck with that) these guns are based on pure luck no skill included spray and pray is the meta this game actually used to be fun (until season <num> smg patches and ridiculous shotty nerfs) if you wish to start playing now just pick up mainly smgs and other spraying weapons <emoji>
__label__helpful__i cant hear footsteps anymore so i die instantly
__label__unhelpful__you can just jump around people with a shotgun and kill them pubg is the answer
__label__helpful__i see people saying this is "pay to win" but that is just flat out liedelusion they tell themselves so they can hate on itthis is the first game in a long time that lets you earn premium game money ingame you dont have to buy it with real money ! if thats your argument for why this game sucks i feel sorry for you cuz you are gonna miss out on all the awesomeness that is fortnite ! (also dont complain that its in beta cuz everyone who has been waiting for this game knew that coming in its not epic games fault you dont do your research) this game starts out slow cuz it wants to ease you into itafter about <num> or so missions the game opens up and gives you more freedomif you stopped after a few missions thinking that was all the game was you are <num> wrong (you eventually have free reign over your personal base but in the beginning you must do what they want you to) lastly i have no problems joining with people soooooi hope this clears everything up !
__label__helpful__nonstop lag throughout matches and poor gunplay and combat make this an incredibly frustrating experience you spend the entire match looting and running all over the place to die upon your first encounter due to unbalanced weaponry when you spend <num> or more minutes gathering items and building loot to only be oneshot by someone with the strongest weapon in the game it really makes the whole point and time you spent in the game a waste to not even be able to get one shot off really makes the game pointless to play why spend a half an hour to not even be able to fire your gun once as the enemy with the best weaponry in the game to oneshot you ? this game is a literal waste of your time
__label__helpful__garbage game with awful mechanics the whole game is spamming structures and hoping your guns hit the target battle royal needs to die already maybe try an actual skilled base game and not free trash games this game gets way to much credit for absolutely nothing any game company that makes cash off of micro transactions is retarded epic why did you give upp gears for this trash !
__label__helpful__it used to be amazing but now it crashes
__label__unhelpful__pubg players triggered cuz their game on xbox is complete trash nd fortnite is doing everything right pubg is dead hello fortnite <emoji>
__label__helpful__lag fest camp fest and guns arent programmed right go pubg
__label__helpful__after playing for <num> minutes i developed brain cancer
__label__helpful__this is a great way to test skill and overall fun but there are some bugs that ruin the game like how sometimes i switch over one slot with a gun and it throws me on the wrong slot with bandages nd gets me killed please fix this
__label__unhelpful__ihave been playing fortnite for about a year and lemme tell you its amazing the controls are easy to learn and whhen playing the sreen is not crowded with info like a lot of some other pvp games because the game is not close to being donethough fn has frequent updates which make the gameplay smoother and better some people complain of lag but after a full year i only encountered one laggy moment that lasted about <num> seconds i highly recommend that you play this game and experience the awesome community strategy and fun gameplay may you get the wins
__label__helpful__still a fun game you get little in reward for your efforts getting better version of playable characters (leveling up a uncommon will never beat a epic etc) or the character themselves are very rare that you might easily drop <num> to get it or you might not dupes are common do have a purpose though the roll packs are very little reward for the most part i suggest waiting till its free lots of crashing as well
__label__unhelpful__don't waste your time on this game the weapons are so unbalanced that it either take <num> bullets to the chest kill one guy then <num> to the head to kill the next the amount of modders are insane i can't tell you how many times someone spawned a minigun out of nowhere as soon as we drop then destroy me if you want my advice go spend the $ <num> for pubg my friend has it and its so much better
__label__helpful__good for epic games to have the where with all to make this type of game
__label__helpful__this is the most unbalanced piece of ever to exist kirby battle royale or minecraft hunger games would honestly be a better choise at this point
__label__unhelpful__i love fortnite <emoji> ifeel like a pro player
__label__helpful__i enjoy it increasing in difficulty mission variety a genuine learning curve compared to a lot of games joining others and seeing their designs have made me always want to use a few ideas the leveling is extensive and loot seems fair even for those getting the $ <num> version despite slightsmall server issues it's still enjoyable filled with bits of frustration
__label__helpful__sorry i'll keep my soul
__label__helpful__dont get me wrong its a good game but i bought the founders pack and i was almost to the end of the tutorial i encountered glich the mini llamas don't work plz someone dont waste your time getting save the world but please fix it
__label__unhelpful__broken garbage words cant describe how this game broken tiered weapons rewarded for luck this game takes <num> skill building is dumb af this is a childspoor mans battle royale play pubg for a real game not this f <num> p greed fest of a game you want cool outfit have fun spending <num> $ on one outfit and another twenty for an axe lol you epic eat ur game the only reason people play this trash is because its free nobody would buy this trash ever ! also fortnite wasnt a br game at first now your team focuses <num> on br and said founders who supported this trash b <num> br epic ill never support another game you make ever
__label__helpful__this game went downhill with all these updates they try to fix things that aren't even broken but leave bugs unfixed and they keep adding pointless weapons each week why don't they just add <num> with <num> update ?
__label__helpful__i love the game itself and i don't like that it will not load into the season <num> game
__label__unhelpful__its good pugb sucks get good
__label__unhelpful__once pubg comes to xbox one this game will die
__label__unhelpful__its okaybut pubg is better
__label__helpful__yd yall make a ps <num> skin but still aint made a xbox skin <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__having a smallish map with <num> people is ridiculous along with this there are sometimes where you would land right in the beginning and walk into a house to see someone already in there with a shotgun that one shots you this hasn't happened once or twice its like every <num> games you will have this problem along with this the rng is very annoying you could be at some place like anarcy acres where you can search a house to only get bullets and bandages but the other house gets a green shotgun <num> white rifle and some grenades furthermoreif you survivehe first <num> minutes i hope you have fun running around trying to either find people to kill or some better gear the only good feeling you can get is from winning everything else will be frustration i hoped you liked this review overall if you're good at pvp then have at it but if not then don't bother keeping this game in the storage in your xbox one update : the game has become overrated and its minecraft survival games wguns
__label__helpful__a game with so much potential but with so many problems ! the lag is horrible the game's controls are horrible the overall gameplay is horrible along with that so many people hack on this game and makers do nothing about for example how is it that i unloaded a legendary rifle in a players back each round making contact just for him to turn around and shoot me in the foot while having <num> hp and shield and i die by the way it showed him with full hp and shield ask anyone who plays this game and they'll probably tell you its horrible too
__label__unhelpful__i have <num> words this game sucks
__label__helpful__i highly recommend this game it is free updates every week different game everytime you play it
__label__unhelpful__novel idea frustrating game play with glitches in every aspect time to delete again after <num> <num> <num> update
__label__helpful__fortnite used to be aa good game (season <num> and half of season <num> ) and it's not even about skill pumps do no damage and noobies end up get the best loot and can kill you easy atlest add it to where we are ranked in so we get people on our skill level and not firstgame noobs or console ninjamyth if we're not on that skill level
__label__helpful__i dont like how you have to pay just to be not called a noob ! also just for a free game it has terrible transaction even though the company needs moneythe gameplay might be fun but its concept is repeated in a wayalso the rng system is kind of balancedbut just for this dumb game my feed is filled with fortnite freaks looking for a team i know the company cant control that thoughin conclusion this is way too popular of a game just for repeated gameplaybut at least its decent
__label__helpful__as time passed i learned cosmetics don't help you win i don't have skins but i have <num> wins total i think we need servers for different skill levels and vbucks based on placement and kills if you had wins before it would be added to your account thank you epic <emoji>
__label__helpful__everything seems fine to me
__label__helpful__i just preordered this game and it looks amazing ! still a bit worried about that $ <num> though
__label__helpful__epic games moar liek bepis games there are not enough deagles good way to keep your virginity
__label__unhelpful__this game is garbage it supposed to be so big and the best game but you cant play it with new update there never good loot and the players are hackers fix your epic this game is trash
__label__unhelpful__its all pay to win im not going to be one of those idiots who waste all of their money on skins the whole game is formed around micro transactions and then the community shames people for not wasting their all their money
__label__unhelpful__this game is not fun and a waste of space the only reason im rating one star is because i cant rate zero stars !
__label__unhelpful__when u realize your original pve game is trash and got no sales so u gotta copy pubg
__label__helpful__i love the game but ever since the newest update that disabled shopping carts whenever i go to the area around the bridge near flush and flush the game freezes and shuts down please fix soon
__label__helpful__this game is awsome it has good graphic the only thing is tha instead of adding new weapons they should fix the old ones
__label__helpful__got the game going ehh ok lets try it <num> hours later im still playing takes shoot and loot and mixes in base deffence wich is actualy very awsome just took me a sec to get used to but in the end its great <num> $ is well well worth it im doubt ill be putting this game down for a week straight <num> addicting
__label__unhelpful__this game is money hungy it's a copy of pubg and the fanbase is toxic ! it's also unfair i will be level <num> and be put a level <num> they stole other people's dances and called them their own like best mates the og was by marlen weeb but what do they do ? they steal it as if it were their own !
__label__unhelpful__i like how its free and all but it makes it free so you can spend money in game kids get addicted to skins even though just sticking to default is fine and plus if you waste youre money on skins theres a chance you might be seen in combat so whats the point of buying it im here to say this game is trash and its my opinion
__label__unhelpful__game is garbage guns are trash and shotguns are <num> inconsistent and the game is <num> luck based also players are rotten and bad sports
__label__unhelpful__to prove it picture two people ne with a grey ar and one with a blue just installed who would win <num> of the time say something besides the blue ar your wrong
__label__helpful__want to know where all the scummy xbox players are ? look no further
__label__helpful__the devolopers are steadilly working on making the game hard rather generating any sort of content after playing stonewood nothing changes except for higher lvl enemies this is a pay to win game do not buy it ! <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__decent game though its a pubg rip off with major lag on servers you die before ever knowing you are in a gun fight because of laggy servers
__label__helpful__this game causes extreme stress and anxiety the game is heavily luck based and is not welcoming to new players the developers just make the game worse instead of bettr and on top of that they do not listen to the community and listen to the child fanbase the game causes a lot of anger and is anything but fun i do not recommend this game to anyone because i don't want them to get the same effects it caused me (anger stress and anxiety)so please do not play this game it is only welcome to very high skilled players and the devs don't listen once so ever so please spare yourself from the horror that is fortnite
__label__unhelpful__ahhhhhh whystraight copy of ddlc ! ginger gunner is sayori like y ? also in titled towers u can actully see sayori dead ! yuri always gets her fire ball jutsu and kills u ! she then fricken eats your wepons ! in moisty mire monika always gets her keyblade and beats u toooooo death ! natsuki is always watching fullmetal alchy ! and says "manga is love manga is life" ! nuuuuuuu ! monika has magic penis power and kills ! im done they ruined ddlc ! <emoji> <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__i hate everything about this game everything in this game is op nerf everything stop people spamming tilted and also just make save the world free
__label__helpful__ok i've seen so many <num> star reviews that are poorly made and barely given out any reasons why they dislike this game if they dislike fortnite then fine i don't blame them it's their opinion but like always plz don't judge a game because of the communityfandom that will lead toxic hatedoms to appear but without that being said let's talk about the things what i like and dislike about fortnite the pros : the building mechanic the art style the iconic emotes the item store (at least it's not p <num> w) the outfitscharacter customization system the gunplay and killing someone and collecting there loot the cons : the gameplay is shallow it's unbalanced the annoying shotguns sometimes there's glitches and it's repetitive (overall) fortnite : battle royale could've been great but it's not i am glad that its popular but it's a little disappointing but it isn't bad (final verdict) <num> needs some work (edit : so i've played save the world mode and it's very good)
__label__helpful__the game is fun and thrilling <emoji> plus it's free !
__label__helpful__<num> damage with shot gun point blank <num> times this game blows
__label__unhelpful__gamers like it and don't like so why not ? <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__title says it all battlegrounds looked more interesting than this
__label__helpful__while the game combines several familiar and common elements from so many games epic games has pull it off in a way that makes this game truely feel and play like an innovative oneofakind orginal ! on the fence i initially spent a few hours reading early alpha reviews and other posts prior to buying the limited edition founders pack ; afterwards i can say with the bonus loot and game keys for friends it was money well spent ! my friends and i are now having a blast after rotating on and off of so many other games this game really offers something for everyone and has it all ! the building customization heroschematicfollower leveling system along with an incredibly diverse and detailed researchskill tree system will undoubtly provide years of fantastic game play in addition the daily login rewards are very generous and actually provide useful items you might think the missions may get repetitious ; but the crafting and progression keep you coming back for more ! ~ enjoy !
__label__unhelpful__i just got the ultimate deluxe edition and it wont even let me play now
__label__helpful__terribad trash game waste of zero dollars
__label__helpful__it is good but very overrated a lot and it haves a lot of bugs the sikns are to expensive <num> $ <num> one
__label__unhelpful__it's a copy of pubg the map is like <num> times smaller than pubg
__label__helpful__do you watch rick and morty ? if so this game is not for you this game is directed for the high school sports ball players ie the intellectually challenged battle royale mode is clearly plagiarised from pubg's avantgarde game designs which gets its inspiration from gambling statistically the odds of winning a game of battle royale is the same as getting a doctorate from harvard a more prestigious and respectable achievement the cartoony art style displays its immature appeal furthermore the character designs show off how well epic games can objectify women a pure luckbased experience to cash out on the battle royale craze the save the world story mode features unimaginative situations it started out with an interesting premise a mysterious outbreak has taken over the world and you team up with a crew of wacky robots to drive them back and then nothing happens you're running the same missions ad nauseam and landscapes are all the same with no sense of progression
__label__helpful__repetitive and boring same thing every match
__label__unhelpful__so this just a kids version of pubg but it is a good game
__label__helpful__trying to milk money from little kids only provides to casual fanbase not the competitive fans recommend if yyou are under <num> <emoji> but if you are above that age i dont recommend
__label__unhelpful__well the game lags too much the hitbox are broken the range of weapons and their spread are also broken i died so many times to hackers with wall speed and aimbot hacks my advice ? wait until pubg gets released on the xbox one this year don't play this overhype garbage
__label__unhelpful__the game is really laggy and glitchy
__label__helpful__calamity has fat and
__label__unhelpful__with so many problems you still add to the game and ignore the problems that come with what you bring
__label__helpful__pretty fun but gets tiring after no that long very repititive even with weekly changes
__label__helpful__epic pls tell your comunetie that no skins have a life
__label__helpful__cant put controller down this game is totally awesome addicting and challenging !
__label__helpful__you can build whatever you like
__label__helpful__all people do is camp behind trees or build a tower to hide in what is the fun in that imo its pretty much like call of duty but with building towers and more players in the match
__label__unhelpful__everything about this game sucks
__label__unhelpful__join the pubg master race
__label__helpful__my pastor told me to delete it or satan will enter my body
__label__unhelpful__the game suddenly freezes your character when in battle every now and then then your dead fix this issue and multiple others this game is broken and the people who play are just annoying well your just playing your game and you have all good loot you might just come across a bush camper or someone using a double pump the most broken thing ever pump do alot of damage but there are those times where you hit a guy for <num> damage and he one shots you sooooo many problems must be fixed in order for a decent game sorry epic i love your games and all but theres just something about this one that gets me <emoji> oh and lower the vbucks prices <num> $ for <num> thing is disappointing now i come back and update this after <num> weeks and its just disappointing i have friends i play with me we all have the same glitch where we cant pull out our gun ! its annoying ! when im landing and some other player decides to land next to me i pick up my weapon try to pull it out nothing happens im done
__label__unhelpful__it a really good game and i recommend it but some thing just dont make sense like the hit boxes are out rages and i shoot someone so many time they dont die they shoot me like three time with a pistol and i die and when i jump they shoot under me and still does damage like ok and mostly every thing about it suuuuuck fixxxxx it the game is garbage pubg is better you game freaking sucks dude so i suggest you fix the game for the thousandth time
__label__unhelpful__this game is fun but it could be better if i didn't go aginst teamers and try hard that will do anything to kill you if you could have people with epic accounts have skill matched players most of the time i have played with starters who get insta killed in the start an also some new items are just random another way ou could fix the game if you make playground have more players like <num> so people can practice also i have been in alot of games where people team but don't get banned also this game is a scam
__label__unhelpful__game is full of scrubs and <num> year olds i wish i could have rated this game <num> stars i played while waiting for pubg to come out and i'll never go back i hope that metor wipes out the entire game and not just tilted towers
__label__helpful__it sucks dont get very bad
__label__helpful__the vbucks\coins you have to buy with real money which sucks they should make it so that every level you get like <num> <num> coins its such a stressful game aswell atleast make a coin system maybe like every win is <num> vbucks and every kill is <num> vbuck that would make the game alot more enjoyable then it is right now
__label__helpful__weapons are extremely unbalanced hit registration is non existant half of the time and spontaneous death occurs way yoo often from a single bullet from anything not to mention the weapon accuracy seems to be luck based
__label__unhelpful__the creators want money and nothing else
__label__unhelpful__man ! this game is great yes the v bucks are totally over priced but no said u have <num> buy them those people who are all like ''fort nte sucks '' r just up set because they suck the game is a great game its very unique <emoji> plus its free just try it if u dont like it delete it <emoji>
__label__unhelpful__i love this game <num> if you dont like it its cuz you cant aim or suck at building or your just trash ♻
__label__unhelpful__not fun and impossible to win
__label__helpful__if you intend on also playing on pc buyplay and link your account on pc first if you play on xbox first epic will lock this game to xbox only it doesn't even matter if you bought the game for both epic will only tell you to make a second account so for those of us who play epic's other games such as unreal tournament or paragon they expect us to create a secondary account just to play fortnite on pc tl : dr link and play fortnite on pc first or you will have to create a second epic account
__label__helpful__this game is trash and boring all luck based as well
__label__helpful__super fun battle royale mode but they need to add a killcam or at least a variation of a killcam because sometimes when i die i want to see how they did it
__label__helpful__dont buy this terrible game this game is boring and i do not recommend it to anyone
__label__helpful__i love this game on my xbox but why isn't it available on the pc ? i just wanna know
__label__helpful__i've been playing since season one hard to believe right ? this game made me fall in love with it but the updates ever since <num> have made the game a salty pool of luck broken mechanics and modesweapons that aren't balanced out before release the old players are leaving the new ones joining for the bandwagon before quiting after a few weeks of playing my friend got me stw and i love it so i hope that if and when br dies the devs [epic] don't do what they're doing to br nowadays epic if you see this andor it makes it your way please stop look at what br used to be and try to bring back the things old players enjoyed ps the weekly updates seemed great when they started in december but they have to stop or at the least be balanced fair mostly working (because ya bad things glitches and exploits occur) and skill based maybe even role based sincerly a season one veteran default
__label__unhelpful__first off this games just hopping on the battle royale band wagon and second the games hitboxes are so random that you can't even hit someone in the chest with a rifle when they are <num> feet away edit : just replayed it for a while and it still sucks
__label__helpful__i dislike that the shotguns are literally snipers and how overpriced skinsemotes etc are but the game is addicting also please stop finishing me right when my teammate is attacking you tryhards
__label__helpful__fix save the world mode there are many bugs and crashes in that mode that aren't getting any attention how could you just push what should be a good game to the side and only improve battle royale save the world should be looking better than br
__label__helpful__let us play against ps <num> people
__label__helpful__i <num> st played this game in september and this game was amazing it had no toxic <num> year olds they listened to the fans ect until season <num> when they blow up to <num> million players they got so money hungry and greedy they stoped listening to the og season <num> player and only listened to the noobs of season <num> and <num> they did awful changes like the removal of the old song that people enjoyed added useless weapons like the stink bomb port o fort ect made the game isolated by the stupidity added smg meta and disappearing skill gap and worst of all they even added a <num> increased bloom count to make the game more "noob friendly ! " but still people spend stupid amounts of money on the galaxy skin battle pass ect the game is still the most viewed game on youtube and twitch even though they lost <num> million players after july it's got sooo cancerous that "ail a and fortnite clickbait are everywhere that i can't even watch a single video without fortnite so in my opinion fortnite will die
__label__unhelpful__i pretty much thought this game would be kinda fun to play after i played it for like an hour it sucked dick the map is too small it's a pubg rip off and there's too many players in the match the guns are just horrible there just for tryhards and you can't even pick what you want your character to look like every players a dick and that's pretty much it from the game is a piece of and i hate it plus you have to buy one the modes like what the hell are you angry money bastard so please kill yourself & delete this game while you're at it you fag gut
__label__unhelpful__this game is horrible ! you gave my son depression ! you crap load of s <emoji> it on my jimmy's screen ! i wasted my money for brain <emoji> washing game ! u have brought my child toshoot others and he says "lit" when he kills someone irl <emoji>
__label__helpful__the longer you play the more the game introduces making it harder and more complicated i've played the game for the better part of today ( <num> ) and i will say that so far i have been enjoying it thoroughly even being stuck playing with random strangers and no communication it's easy enough that you don't necessarily need communication although believe me it helps the further you progress the more types of baddies the game introduces and the harder and stronger they become the skill tree becomes increasingly larger and slightly more confusing the more you level up and i will say the thing i have been annoyed with the most is the lack of clear description or explanation for a lot of game mechanics specifically having to do with survivors squads and other such things you deal with in the menus but to be fair some things i've given up in confusion on get explained just a few story missions later has a great feature that allows to rejoin ongoing game if your game crashes
__label__helpful__fix ur game u
__label__unhelpful__its <num> : <num> am and istill can't access the game im still hyped though
__label__helpful__i did played fortnite but oh boy this game make me dying easy myself because i never played battle player unknown and of course fortnite not interested this game <emoji>
__label__helpful__its fun and addictive but the new update ruined it completely the game lags way to much and ruins the experience old fortnite was better
__label__helpful__i've been playing since season one and it got better in season <num> and <num> but then they started to go downhill more debuffs and buffs start coming along with glitches the rpg radius was debuffed making it more likely not to hit anyone even on direct contact then shotguns were debuffed making it more likely to do <num> damage to a player with a pump or tact then c <num> s were buffed making it be able to destroy half a building in tilted then the shopping cart glitch and the walking through walls glitch happened then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ars and other guns fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a victory royale <num> or <num> vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more moneyi hope u found this useful
__label__helpful__great game but give us free skins too
__label__helpful__inconsistent damage trash building trash gameplay for as many updates this game gets its still worse than pubg
__label__unhelpful__the graphics and i don't like is that you cannot change your appearance of your character
__label__helpful__i literally wait for an hour to get in a server and once im done it keeps giving me more minutes they might as well have told me to go myself in the !
__label__unhelpful__from worst to insanely terrible to their getaway update they now have you getting rid of an item and make you grab the weapon instead of swapping most of the weapons still suck and the goddamn getaway mode ! it puts you in a smaller space and then you have to reach in the goddamn back of the goddamn van ! ladies and gentlemen this has been crowned as the worst and broken br game in history they should've stuck with the jackrabbit
__label__unhelpful__lags all the time bullets dont register such a cheap bs game
__label__helpful__if you really think about it there is a whole lot of other games out there that deserves recognition and should have a massive multiplayer community but this is what really i see everywhere ? i know thats because its a trend everybody i know irl or through xbox grinds this including me but in reality its not even that fun i just wish this game will die sooner than later (please) i have been playing this non stop since season <num> stealing ws but dont get a free skin just emotes and a free lolipop axe so far smh
__label__unhelpful__the shotgun needs to be capped at <num> damage while point blank its mid rang damage needs to be reduced ! it makes no sense how a blue pump can do <num> damage from mid range !
__label__helpful__game won't even open anymore
__label__unhelpful__any game where you can buy your rank instead of earning it through hours of grinding deserves negative stars
__label__helpful__in a large bowl sift together the flour baking powder salt and sugar make a well in the center and pour in the milk egg and melted butter ; mix until smooth heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle using approximately <num> cup for each pancake game isn't worth talking about heres a pancake recipe
__label__helpful__the game has too many crashes and cra almost finished with tier <num> defense need to fix bugs with game
__label__helpful__fortnite used to be a fun but challenging game now its full of too many guns too many gimmicks and full of people in the fanbase that want things that will make the game even more luck based than it already is its should be pretty easy to fix your game epic
__label__helpful__you wanna play the most bestest game ever play this
__label__helpful__i have had this game since it came out i fell in love with it immediately nearly every part of the game perfect then the game started feeding its money from skins and season passes that was really the beginning of the end epic started adding stupid and unnecessary items rather than fix any of the game breaking bugs and exploits seems like they're worried more about making skins more than anything else lets not forget the unbelievable skill gap network connection (which used to be perfect) and the unnecessary amount of items the amount of items in this game come pretty close to the amount of experiencable issues as well it's a shame to see how far this game has gone downhill
__label__unhelpful__the game just freezes then boots you out
__label__helpful__its fun with friends but epic needs to stop adding and start fixing
__label__helpful__this game is decent fun and addicting pve and pvp are great you don't need to spend money to progress and to the people whining about its price as a game when its released for free you get your money refunded so chill out
__label__unhelpful__alice texas toast with peanut butter and chocolate milk please let me know if we have to work on my phone is it going today i am not in a good day i love that movie with you candy and chips please give me a phone
__label__helpful__can it stop crashing on season <num>
__label__unhelpful__it's straight garbage minecraft is better than this !
__label__unhelpful__the game is good but could you give free vbucks because i dont have any pls my name is washingb i on xbox pls send my vbucks like <num> vbucks pls
__label__helpful__when i first started playing i knew it was going to be a great game and it was and was playing at the time around season <num> and it is still a great game
__label__unhelpful__<emoji> supposed to be <num> star
__label__unhelpful__the game keeps giving me an hour wait time before i get to play bullsht
__label__unhelpful__if you are a major buy in you'll love this game personally it feels like you are nerfed otherwise i despise no i loathe this game
__label__helpful__this was a great game till they broke it time and time again servers go down almost every week lazy devs and clearly board as well to let this petty shit happen the next cockstar in the making fix you epic
__label__helpful__i like that we can as many people and win but i hate the lag
__label__unhelpful__it's ok <emoji> i mean i won <num> times on this game yeah so i like this game
__label__helpful__it is fun but i cant play save the world anymore because whenever i go on it it says to claim the rewards for a mission but when click on it it says that i cant cause a deferral key is active and when i click continue it just sends me back to claim the rewards and into an endless loop
__label__helpful__the game has gotten better with these last updates it seems to run smoother even in <num> v <num> that gamtype i lagged alot it was so bad people were invisible i still get annoyed with bloom shots but its whatever just weird you can hit someone and not do damage ? cool thing is that you guys update frequently and add new things to the game the challenges are a big plus as well !
__label__unhelpful__hurry up with playground mode <emoji>
__label__helpful__shameful rip off of pubg packed with gimmicks that cater only to luck and crappy players cant win a firefight ? build some walls or hop around vigorously cant aim ? spam rockets and grenades cant figure out where to go ? the maps tiny so dont worry dont have an attention span ? thats ok theres very little content compared to games like pubg also always rewards luck over skill you could die the second your feet hit the ground because the other guys landing spot had something and yours didnt or you could make it to last two people with <num> kills and get blown up by a camping <num> year old with a lucky blind rocket shot it is free and kinda playable but you get what you pay for
__label__helpful__ok now im done you dont want to fix it fine your product is now just going to be reported for poor performance i have asked you guys to fix many times and sunk my hard earned money into it if you wont do anything then i will
__label__unhelpful__i need vbucks and refunds
__label__helpful__i think that fortnite should have <num> stars not <num> this game is way over hyped it's mediocre at best it's very repetitive and it's boring when you play by yourself one more thing all of the customization stuff is too expensive even though the game is free it's still not worth emptying your pockets for a stupid skin that looks cool the legendary skins cost $ <num> which equals <num> vbucks it's slightly fun when you're playing with friends i would not recommend to anyone
__label__unhelpful__this game is pure honestly the servers never work and when your about to get a win you get some massive lag which is annoying because then you loose or die so honestly screw this retarded game
__label__helpful__the tutorial is long begining map sector is too easy to the point where you dont even need to build defences if you make it past the first few hours i think its fun but could get old pretty fast recommend playing with friends blast through the beginning and it gets more challenging btw this game will be free next year if you don't want to risk buying it
__label__helpful__epicgames needs to give xbox players a free skin
__label__unhelpful__fortnite is a very good battle royale game there's one thing i must point out however i had just noticed that the epic tactical shotgun has been removed please bring this gun back into fortnite : battle royale
__label__unhelpful__the hype is not real
