And please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions. If you fixed the game like this, I would give the game four out of five stars. UPDATE, Jan 8, STILL GARBAGE, THE GAME HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE, The silenced pistol is way overpowered, you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone. ALSO, SHOTGUNS ARE STILL OVERPOWERED LOWER THEIR DAMAGE. I TRYED PUBG AND AT LEAST THAT GAME HAS BALANCED HEALTH AND WEAPON DAMAGE PLUS THERE ARE NO SHIELD POTIONS TO BE FOUND IN PUBG UPDATE JAN 19 Lag is fixed so heres 2 stars SHOTGUNS ARE STILL WAY OVERPOWERED, I have no more room left so \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4c",

All of the 8 year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop, as this game deserves at least 4.5 stars. The shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know, as well as some other serious problems like STW scammers and lag. If you are under 10 years of age you probably shouldn't play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some 32 year old tryhard, so For the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are 10 or older. Try to not think about the glitches and other cons, and just have fun. I also highly recommend buying save the world, but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed.

They are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side show.But its not all bad knews.you can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of 30 $.",

Even if you don't like the game, it's free so you might as well try it. I love that you are able to build in battles, or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win. I also like the storm slowly going over the map, pushing in all the remaining players to one small area. I also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find. From rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge! I also like the stuff that you can get loot from. You can get loot from hot air balloons, from the ground, or you can get loot from golden chests! I most of all love the extra modes that they add in. My favorite is Playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want! What I don't really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get. Overall, I think you should get it!",
