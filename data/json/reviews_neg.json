And please lower the damage of the shotguns and also please lower how many hits you can tank with the shield potions. If you fixed the game like this, I would give the game four out of five stars. UPDATE, Jan 8, STILL GARBAGE, THE GAME HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE, The silenced pistol is way overpowered, you can just mash the trigger button and you will kill anyone. ALSO, SHOTGUNS ARE STILL OVERPOWERED LOWER THEIR DAMAGE. I TRYED PUBG AND AT LEAST THAT GAME HAS BALANCED HEALTH AND WEAPON DAMAGE PLUS THERE ARE NO SHIELD POTIONS TO BE FOUND IN PUBG UPDATE JAN 19 Lag is fixed so heres 2 stars SHOTGUNS ARE STILL WAY OVERPOWERED, I have no more room left so \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4c",

All of the 8 year olds complaining about getting killed need to stop, as this game deserves at least 4.5 stars. The shotgun damage is pretty inconsistent i know, as well as some other serious problems like STW scammers and lag. If you are under 10 years of age you probably shouldn't play this game as you will most likely drive a hammer through our xbox after getting killed by some 32 year old tryhard, so For the sake of your xbox dont play this unless you are 10 or older. Try to not think about the glitches and other cons, and just have fun. I also highly recommend buying save the world, but if you do dont trade unless you want to be scammed.

They are making building which is the main attraction into a shriveling up side show.But its not all bad knews.you can still buy outfits sets for the low low price of 30 $.",

Even if you don't like the game, it's free so you might as well try it. I love that you are able to build in battles, or build a huge base with your friends and defend it against other players to get the win. I also like the storm slowly going over the map, pushing in all the remaining players to one small area. I also like all the different choices of weapons that you can find. From rocket launchers to pistols the choices are huge! I also like the stuff that you can get loot from. You can get loot from hot air balloons, from the ground, or you can get loot from golden chests! I most of all love the extra modes that they add in. My favorite is Playground mode where just you and your friends can build anything they want! What I don't really like is the nerf they put on shotguns and the amount of lag you can get. Overall, I think you should get it!",

One thing that really bothers me though is the fact that you can not look at your coordinates. This can be very frustrating especially if you are big into building and mining. for the price ($9.99) it is a good buy, but once the price goes back up and it is the same as the PC edition ($26.99) I would suggest just getting the PC edition instead",

Now though, this and PE have been advanced leaps and bounds over what they were a year ago, and to my knowledge, this game has suddenly gotten a LOT of what was missing before. That said, it's still un-moddable and continues to be behind the Java counterpart for releases. Since I'm reviewing on a PC with a mouse and keyboard, my review might be biased, but I think this app is a waste for PC users. If you're using a Surface on the go or a W10 phone, this app is the only way you'll be able to play, at which point I recommend getting it. If you're a PC user, I would recommend investing more into the Java version at Minecraft.net.",

Java is based and built from C++ however it isn't C++ nor as powerful at the low levels that C++ can be. This is indeed being remade, however it has a baseline they are recoding it in C++ from the original Java source code base. This takes time and some revamping on some procedures, methods and class's. That being said the C++ version (Windows 10) is far superior in performance or at the very least will be when it is all finished. Currently it is still beta with features being added. This takes time to redo the entire codebase were talking millions of lines of code in fact at least 30% more than the original Java version. Also they are coding for virtual reality systems too.",

The java version handled this perfectly using a wire-frame highlight. 2.) Particles disperse nicely except in confined spaces where they bunch up against the wall and fill the \"working\" screen real estate. Perhaps consider making particles smaller and causing them to bounce off walls? 3.) In app purchases. These hurt consumer confidence especially when making something based on a beloved game that was built entirely with consumer-first thinking. DON'T DO IT! 4.) So far so good; I really like it.

Don't get me wrong, this is brilliant if you are playing on a phone, but, as a PC version, this is terribly tedious.

Controllers are good for some things, racing games, platformers, but not for first person adventure/shooter. The controls are clumsy and imprecise. I will not play the MS version of this game till they fix at least the keyboard and mouse controls. I suspect there are quite a few other major annoyances that don't exist in the java client as well but I won't find them till they fix the biggest issue.",

When you're completely new to the game, it's hard to figure out what's going on and what you're supposed to be doing without ANY tutorial... I find it very poor. Quests in BS really help you understand the game and send you off on a great adventure. 2. Recipe book is completely missing in Minecraft. I find it very handy in Block Story to explore new tools, weapons, armor options etc to conquer the next level. I'm completely lost without a recipe book in Minecraft. 3. Game controls... especially on the crafting table. For example, separating items from a stack can be a challenge. Had no issues in Block Story, but still am straggling in Minecraft. Again, tutorial would be very handy. Please, think about newbies!",

Meaning if all you have is your moms work laptop to read this, your out of luck. 2. Too much like mobile This game looks like it was made for tablets, from the U.I, to the controls, and to the graphics.

When I enter either of the two accessible menus, the background spins normally, music play, and that's all.

Sure, I may not have seen a few things before, but I mean, come on. It's the same thing you can get off of the iPad, just with better controls. I have no idea what multiplayer is like, remember this is the free version. Crafting is a bit of a pain, and even more so when you don't get any tips. Here's what the free version has; no creative, no tips on how to do things, no multiplayer. I don't see any need to buy this, unless you love Minecraft. Hope this was helpful. ~Peace all.",

It is online play only(no campaign) You do have option to single, duo, or s/quad play. It does have a BIG map and what I hear , after fully complete there will be 3. So, lots of learning. Oh, this preview does NOT come with a manual. More fun to learn that way. All in all, Hopefully this game gets fixed in the near decade before PUBG 2 comes out. Until then, have fun gamers!!!",

AND on top of that, his yokai is horrible. you have to be SO PRECISE in order for it to work AND it deosnt recharge fast enough. either he needs to be REMOVED OR the maps need to be updated.
