It's easy enough that you don't necessarily need communication although believe me it helps. The further you progress the more types of baddies the game introduces, and the harder and stronger they become. The skill tree becomes increasingly larger and slightly more confusing the more you level up, and I will say the thing I have been annoyed with the most is the lack of clear description or explanation for a lot of game mechanics, specifically having to do with survivors, squads and other such things you deal with in the menus. BUT, to be fair, SOME things I've given up in confusion on get explained just a few story missions later. Has a great feature that allows to rejoin ongoing game if your game crashes.",

Its supposed to do less damage than the pump, but lets just say, with this weapon who needs a sniper. That brings us to the snipers. Specifically the Semi and the Bolt. Each bullet you shoot has a faster drop rate than your prom dates. The theres the rifles. The Burst and the Full Auto. Each one is terrible in its own way. The Burst has the spray of a pornstar, and the Full Auto hits like a pea shooter. Then the Submachine gun, oh and its direct retarded cousin, The Tacticle version. Both are just god awful, like God wouldn't use these to kill people. He'd use the revolver, which has the best accuracy. So in general. Just wait for PUBG. Not this.\"",

If thats your argument for why this game sucks, I feel sorry for you cuz you are gonna miss out on all the awesomeness that is FORTNITE!!! (Also, dont complain that its in beta, cuz everyone who has been waiting for this game knew that coming in, its not Epic Games fault you dont do your research) This game starts out slow cuz it wants to ease you into it.....after about 10 or so missions, the game opens up and gives you more freedom.....if you stopped after a few missions, thinking that was all the game was, you are 100% wrong (You eventually have free reign over your personal base, but in the beginning, you must do what they want you to) Lastly, I have NO problems joining with people, sooooo......I hope this clears everything up!!!",

There are some problems, like odd hit detection and a very steep learning curve. For a free to play game however (or partly free anyway), this is incredibly good. I love the style of the game as well. Most games in this genre all want to be realistic, but this one takes a chaotic cartoony approach that feels and plays very differently then the other games in the genre (For reference, I have played H1Z1 and PuBG). If you want a realistic experience, then this is not the game for you. Otherwise, I would recommend trying it out at least. Personally, I enjoy the alternate game modes best like 50v50. I recommend playing with friends, as playing alone can be boring at times. Oh, and did I mention cross play? I often play this game on PC with friends on Xbox or mobile. You can't play with PSN players sadly.",

I don't blame them, it's their opinion. But like always, plz don't judge a game because of the community/fandom, that will lead toxic hatedoms to appear. But without that being said, let's talk about the things what I like and dislike about Fortnite. The pros: The building mechanic, the art style, the iconic emotes, the item store, (at least it's not p2w) the outfits/character customization system, the gunplay, and killing someone and collecting there loot. The cons: The gameplay is shallow, it's unbalanced, the annoying shotguns, sometimes there's glitches, and it's repetitive. (Overall) Fortnite: Battle Royale could've been great, but it's not. I am glad that its popular, but it's a little disappointing but it isn't bad. (Final Verdict) 6/10 needs some work. (Edit: So I've played Save the world mode, and it's very good.)",

The quest rotate every few hrs or so, same quest just different locations. They throw in daily challenges, trials to help but are still played on these same maps. Its not till levels 20-45 when you first see new locations in the game, they do add a few new enemies as you progress. Just with all that depht the gameplay itself falls short filled with repetition an a lot of grinding with drops that you don't need an looking for the ones u do need for crafting.

The cartoony art style displays its immature appeal. Furthermore, the character designs show off how well Epic Games can objectify women. A pure luck-based experience to cash out on the battle royale craze. The Save the World story mode features unimaginative situations. It started out with an interesting premise. A mysterious outbreak has taken over the world, and you team up with a crew of wacky robots to drive them back. And then nothing happens.

Fortnight BR is FREE while Pubg costs $30.00 Both are fun just depends on your play style",

EPIC, if you see this and/or it makes it your way, please stop, look at what BR used to be and try to bring back the things old players enjoyed. P.s the weekly updates seemed great when they started in december but, they have to stop or at the least be balanced, fair, mostly working (because ya bad things, glitches, and exploits occur), and skill based- maybe even role based.

Some mechanics take a little getting used to, but not the worst learning curve I've encountered. No, my issues begin and end with the fact that they are selling a closed beta to a free to play game for $60. Basically what they are selling you is $60 worth of in-game purchases, and you are paying them to beta test their game for them. It's a kickstarter campaign marketed as a full game. This brings me to what really bothers me, and it is that in none of their marketing did they make clear that this is only a beta, nor were they upfront about this being destined for free-to-play status. Even on this page that fact is barley a footnote. I would probably feel different if they had been more transparent about what this really is, or they didn't charge a full $60. Again, not a horrible game, but not worth the fee.",

I will refer to the modes as STW and BR in this review. Although I really don't like this game, I will still give an honest, unbias review. To start off, STW is more for a player with time to give, while BR is just something to play when your bored or for a player who just wants pure action. I really don't like how Epic Games focuses primarily on the BR game mode, for example, all of the screenshots for the game is the BR map. Another example is that they changed the whole game's name to \"Fortnite Battle Royale.\" STW deserves more attention considering BR probably wouldn't exist if STW was never made. The building feature creates a unique aspect of Fortnite, making it a very popular and competitive game for most ages. Overall, Epic Games does a great job at keeping their game relevant with the weekly content updates and interesting map changes.",

Collect building materials so you can defend yourself, and others if you play Duos and Squads. With all this happening, a huge barrier, (The Storm) closes in on all 100 players. If you win, you get a message saying #1 Victory Royale! And the all-to-well-known umbrella. Repeat! I mainly like Fortnite because of the strategy used.

Then c4s were buffed making it be able to destroy half a building in Tilted. Then the shopping cart glitch and The Walking through walls glitch happened. then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ARs and other guns. fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a Victory royale. 25 or 50 vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more money.I hope u found this useful.",

I'd recommend PUBG if you are looking for a game that has significantly less lag, BS, Cheaters, and server problems. Server problems happening all the time, as in about five times a month. On top of that it takes hours or days to get through a login queue, just to have it fail and wait again.

Then here comes the SMG'S. This SMG meta has torn apart the game more then anything. And the fact that their is no double shotty to counter it is sad, very sad. Building is what made this game unique and fun, and it was just about the only skill gap in the game. Now it doesn't even matter how fast you build or who is the better builder, it's about who has the better SMG and who gets lucky with there bloom shots. Literally it's making games shorter because their is rarely any build fights anymore. Not to mention that shotguns are completely garbage now.
