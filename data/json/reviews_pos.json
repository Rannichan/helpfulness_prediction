It's easy enough that you don't necessarily need communication although believe me it helps. The further you progress the more types of baddies the game introduces, and the harder and stronger they become. The skill tree becomes increasingly larger and slightly more confusing the more you level up, and I will say the thing I have been annoyed with the most is the lack of clear description or explanation for a lot of game mechanics, specifically having to do with survivors, squads and other such things you deal with in the menus. BUT, to be fair, SOME things I've given up in confusion on get explained just a few story missions later. Has a great feature that allows to rejoin ongoing game if your game crashes.",

Its supposed to do less damage than the pump, but lets just say, with this weapon who needs a sniper. That brings us to the snipers. Specifically the Semi and the Bolt. Each bullet you shoot has a faster drop rate than your prom dates. The theres the rifles. The Burst and the Full Auto. Each one is terrible in its own way. The Burst has the spray of a pornstar, and the Full Auto hits like a pea shooter. Then the Submachine gun, oh and its direct retarded cousin, The Tacticle version. Both are just god awful, like God wouldn't use these to kill people. He'd use the revolver, which has the best accuracy. So in general. Just wait for PUBG. Not this.\"",

If thats your argument for why this game sucks, I feel sorry for you cuz you are gonna miss out on all the awesomeness that is FORTNITE!!! (Also, dont complain that its in beta, cuz everyone who has been waiting for this game knew that coming in, its not Epic Games fault you dont do your research) This game starts out slow cuz it wants to ease you into it.....after about 10 or so missions, the game opens up and gives you more freedom.....if you stopped after a few missions, thinking that was all the game was, you are 100% wrong (You eventually have free reign over your personal base, but in the beginning, you must do what they want you to) Lastly, I have NO problems joining with people, sooooo......I hope this clears everything up!!!",

There are some problems, like odd hit detection and a very steep learning curve. For a free to play game however (or partly free anyway), this is incredibly good. I love the style of the game as well. Most games in this genre all want to be realistic, but this one takes a chaotic cartoony approach that feels and plays very differently then the other games in the genre (For reference, I have played H1Z1 and PuBG). If you want a realistic experience, then this is not the game for you. Otherwise, I would recommend trying it out at least. Personally, I enjoy the alternate game modes best like 50v50. I recommend playing with friends, as playing alone can be boring at times. Oh, and did I mention cross play? I often play this game on PC with friends on Xbox or mobile.

I don't blame them, it's their opinion. But like always, plz don't judge a game because of the community/fandom, that will lead toxic hatedoms to appear. But without that being said, let's talk about the things what I like and dislike about Fortnite. The pros: The building mechanic, the art style, the iconic emotes, the item store, (at least it's not p2w) the outfits/character customization system, the gunplay, and killing someone and collecting there loot. The cons: The gameplay is shallow, it's unbalanced, the annoying shotguns, sometimes there's glitches, and it's repetitive. (Overall) Fortnite: Battle Royale could've been great, but it's not. I am glad that its popular, but it's a little disappointing but it isn't bad. (Final Verdict) 6/10 needs some work. (Edit: So I've played Save the world mode, and it's very good.)",

The quest rotate every few hrs or so, same quest just different locations. They throw in daily challenges, trials to help but are still played on these same maps. Its not till levels 20-45 when you first see new locations in the game, they do add a few new enemies as you progress. Just with all that depht the gameplay itself falls short filled with repetition an a lot of grinding with drops that you don't need an looking for the ones u do need for crafting.

The cartoony art style displays its immature appeal. Furthermore, the character designs show off how well Epic Games can objectify women. A pure luck-based experience to cash out on the battle royale craze. The Save the World story mode features unimaginative situations. It started out with an interesting premise. A mysterious outbreak has taken over the world, and you team up with a crew of wacky robots to drive them back. And then nothing happens.

Fortnight BR is FREE while Pubg costs $30.00 Both are fun just depends on your play style",

EPIC, if you see this and/or it makes it your way, please stop, look at what BR used to be and try to bring back the things old players enjoyed. P.s the weekly updates seemed great when they started in december but, they have to stop or at the least be balanced, fair, mostly working (because ya bad things, glitches, and exploits occur), and skill based- maybe even role based.

Some mechanics take a little getting used to, but not the worst learning curve I've encountered. No, my issues begin and end with the fact that they are selling a closed beta to a free to play game for $60. Basically what they are selling you is $60 worth of in-game purchases, and you are paying them to beta test their game for them. It's a kickstarter campaign marketed as a full game. This brings me to what really bothers me, and it is that in none of their marketing did they make clear that this is only a beta, nor were they upfront about this being destined for free-to-play status. Even on this page that fact is barley a footnote. I would probably feel different if they had been more transparent about what this really is, or they didn't charge a full $60. Again, not a horrible game, but not worth the fee.",

I will refer to the modes as STW and BR in this review. Although I really don't like this game, I will still give an honest, unbias review. To start off, STW is more for a player with time to give, while BR is just something to play when your bored or for a player who just wants pure action. I really don't like how Epic Games focuses primarily on the BR game mode, for example, all of the screenshots for the game is the BR map. Another example is that they changed the whole game's name to \"Fortnite Battle Royale.\" STW deserves more attention considering BR probably wouldn't exist if STW was never made. The building feature creates a unique aspect of Fortnite, making it a very popular and competitive game for most ages. Overall, Epic Games does a great job at keeping their game relevant with the weekly content updates and interesting map changes.",

Collect building materials so you can defend yourself, and others if you play Duos and Squads. With all this happening, a huge barrier, (The Storm) closes in on all 100 players. If you win, you get a message saying #1 Victory Royale! And the all-to-well-known umbrella. Repeat! I mainly like Fortnite because of the strategy used.

Then c4s were buffed making it be able to destroy half a building in Tilted. Then the shopping cart glitch and The Walking through walls glitch happened. then bullets started going through people or not hitting people on direct while not doing any damage at all even with ARs and other guns. fortnite doesnt even give you a few bucks when you get a Victory royale. 25 or 50 vbucks would wk but epic games is too greedy and want you to buy vbucks so they make even more money.I hope u found this useful.",

I'd recommend PUBG if you are looking for a game that has significantly less lag, BS, Cheaters, and server problems. Server problems happening all the time, as in about five times a month. On top of that it takes hours or days to get through a login queue, just to have it fail and wait again.

Then here comes the SMG'S. This SMG meta has torn apart the game more then anything. And the fact that their is no double shotty to counter it is sad, very sad. Building is what made this game unique and fun, and it was just about the only skill gap in the game. Now it doesn't even matter how fast you build or who is the better builder, it's about who has the better SMG and who gets lucky with there bloom shots. Literally it's making games shorter because their is rarely any build fights anymore. Not to mention that shotguns are completely garbage now.

When I heard that Windows 10 edition was coming out, I felt optimistic for the future (plus I basically had two free copies from the Java versions I bought). It was nice, but didn't live up to my expectations. Now I see that there are micro-transactions everywhere. This is exactly the direction I didn't want the game to go. Locking down the community and making you pay for everything. Microsoft is forcing everyone to leave the Java edition, by making every other version compatible with one another, except for good old Java. Buy the Java version, since you can play on Windows 10 with it, but also because it comes with a free copy of Windows 10. TL;DR: Buy the Java version. You can thank me later.",

Also, I'm not sure if this is a glitch, but the iron golem killed me, and when I came back into the village, it killed me again. They should also add the \"Pirate Speak\" language to the game. I also noticed that most of the features are from PE edition, like the fallen trees. Another thing is that in the trial, you can't do any sort of customization for your world.

And while it's very fun, there's still TONS of room for improvement in the Windows 10 Edition. While calling this particular version \"stripped down\" might be unfair, I've learned (the hard way) that this edition is based off of the earlier Pocket Edition of Minecraft, which lacks many of the features of the original PC Edition. What I'd really like to see added to Minecraft: Windows 10 are more options that enable people with slower PCs to play the game without worrying about big performance issues. (Minecraft, after all, is a surprisingly resource-demanding game!) That's the main thing I'd like to see added to this edition, but there are also other changes I'd like to see made. Some of the block/item types (stained glass, for example) and structures (woodland mansions, for example) should really be added to future updates to improve gameplay.",

I have tried Minecraft on my iPad, and on my Android phone but none had the functionality and full capacity that the PC version did. One thing that left me wanting though was controller compatibility. I had an xbox controller but to use it with Minecraft, I had to use 3rd party programs, which were a pain to work with. Alas, we have the perfect combination of a full Minecraft game, with the simplistic menus of the tablet version, and the controller option that I've been wanting all along! It's good so far! 1 thing though. When I pause the game, I expect everything to freeze right when I hit pause. Save me from a quick death or maybe just going out to type a review. But it keeps running even when paused. Dangerous when against enemies. Please fix this annoyance and it will be 5.",

Although I know how to setup a server for the original version of Minecraft, I appreciate how this version is extremely easy to use for the newcomers to the game. Just start a world and boom, you instantly have a server that others can play on (even people with Pocket Edition can join too!) the while on the original version it can be a bit more annoying at times. However, it is lacking modding and some features from the original version. Also, having to pay for texture packs is egregious and ridiculous (texture packs on the original are free). Once it gets the features from the original version, it will be the quintessential version of Minecraft because of the incredible optimization.",

If they do similar things for the other GUIs, like the furnace and chests, it will be much better. There are optimizations to the GUI in general that they could make, but it's hard to say in the first Beta what they will change. There are many complaints about redstone (which isn't in Pocket Edition yet, so they'll have to add it to this version separately), and a bunch of little complaints about things that they will hopefully change.

I hope to see more features added to this version besides the intended vanilla features, perhaps we can get some cross-platform multiplayer going on with Xbox One? Many of the negative reviews I see complain about in-app purchases (limited to skins, but you still have the option to import your own skins for free) and even more of the negative reviews treat this game as a finished product. Again, this is BETA. It's an unfinished product. It says BETA in the title, but let's be honest here.

Mojang needs money to pay their employees to basically code/develop/improve/fix Minecraft Win10/PE. If this was free they would need to stop making Minecraft Win/PE. 2. This is a port Minecraft PE (Pocket Edition) for Windows 10. The description even says this is not Minecraft Java Edition! Go on the Minecraft wiki if you want too! Minecraft PE is a version of Minecraft in C++, a much faster programming language than Java. Mojang says that they will roll out updates on Java BEFORE PE/Win10 THEN they will apply them to other versions. That's why Java has more features!

Very easy dl and account mgt. Friends connectivity through Live is also fantastic. Great start! Needs improvement: Absolutely need dedicated server and more stable multi-play. It does tend to crash or lag at times for those connecting. (just 2 intranet struggled at times) MC is supposed to be a real-time world. You can't just shutdown and nothing happens. I want to come back and see my wheat grown and my town nuked by creepers. I do eventually want to see plugin/mod capability. These are the lifeblood of MC and keep the interest level up.",

It seems like this will be a fantastic version of the game when it gets fully released. However, a huge complaint I have is that you can't customize controls yet. I'm a left handed person who can't use my right hand very well except for easy tasks, so generally I like to move my character with the arrow keys using my right hand and do everything else with my left. Also there are a few things that make it hard to use the controller as well, but that may just be me not used to a new layout yet. So for now the game is a bit awkward and challenging to play physically. I'll keep trudging on because I absolutely love minecraft, but please work on this feature soon so I can play fully.",

However it isn't recommended for anyone without windows 10, since it will most likely crash as soon as you launch the game. But it is pretty much a polished version of the pocket addition so the UI is very big (Unless you play this on a Microsoft surface... in that case it should work to it's fullest in terms of the UI). But apart from that I think this version can grow into a non-laggy / smoother version of Minecraft. Unless you hate Minecraft...in that case GET OUT...sorry... But overall you should get this game since for now it should work on lower-end computers as long as you have windows 10 ...Now how do I go full screen?? (No really. How)? Also I love the new Row-Boats :p",

I Hope Minecraft Gets a Little More Creative in New update. I wait and wait for an update, But it's Not there for me, So I have the Builds If No Update, I Hope Someone Comment About This Saying That Mojang Needs To Make New Items in New Updates like PC Does, PC gets lots of items added than MCPE. But I Still love This Game, I used to have Blocklauncher But It Doesn't Have A Update, So I Switched To MCPE Master, It's Fun!, So Plz Enjoy",

For example, it uses the PC crafting menu, which is fine and all, but it's not set up well for touch screen users. There's no easy way to pick up or drop a single item out of a stack, making crafting stupidly tedious. Some kind of auto-crafting menu like the console version or android version would be nice. At least as an option. Or at the very least making picking up single items out of a single stack easier. Another minor annoyance with touch screen controls, is that you can't manually move the controls around onscreen. The d-pad is a bit too low. I keep getting to close to the bottom of the screen when I press down. You also can't disable auto-jump when touch screen mode is on.",

Minus the frequent crashes, with the new updates the game has been having, the UI is now mostly migrated from the Pocket Edition's elements, making the game feel much better. There is an instant switch between touch/keyboard/gamepad, for when you press a button or preform an action the game instantly adjusts to what device you just used. This is useful for switching to a controller if you want to relax. Now that I have an Xbox 360 controller to play around with, using it with Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition was almost flawless. The only thing I noticed that could be a possible downside was the sluggish inventory navigation, since Crafting is a thing. Sprinting was also difficult as it didn't have its own designated button.

The only problem is the fact that it doesn't support split-screen co-op like the Xbox version does, and with already including controller support, I feel kind of cheated.",

It has a few drawbacks though. One the interface is meant for phones so don't expect sensible PC design but rather pudgy phonlet design. Two you don't get some of the same freedoms that you can get with the regular Java version. As far as I know there is no way of moding or skining this version of minecraft, and the Windows store indicates there are or at least will be in app purchases so skins that you have to pay for. I haven't tested everything in the game more of just skimmed to see if the other reviews are correct and indeed this just seems to be a mobile port for the time being.",

I can only ask some changes to be made as this will catch up to PC and Xbox editions. First, I want to ask that chests have the same interface as the PC and Xbox. Another is that I want there to be commands like in the PC. That way, you could make mini games. I love how it can cross-platform with the PE (although the PE isn't updated yet). It says 5 stars but I'll give it 10 stars. Plus, the touch screen controls are so reliable. I like how many features the PC has, but it is often slow and crashes servers a lot. The Xbox is easy to do parkour with, but has problems with controls. The PE is annoying with only touch screen and small buttons. Therefore, the W10 Edition is the best edition! (Deborah's Son):-)",

The integration of Xbox Live makes this title much easier to get into with friends but be warned: You will not have massive server population like in the Java version. I believe this version only supports up to 7 players on one server. It's a good price for a good game but until it acquires more functions to match up to the Java version you are to expect a slightly limited playing experience. Despite that I highly recommend this version of the game if you want stability and you don't mind vanilla gameplay.",

The gui is harder to navigate due to is layout and functionality is based more for a tablet than a Win 10 PC. The graphics are a bit smoother, the game renders a little faster, and boats are actually usable (they were tricky to operate in the PC version). One thing I miss is the variety of blocks and the ability to add mods that were in the PC version. It would also be nice to import my favorite Minecraft PC world in to the Win 10 Ed. I also think having a variety of locked skins that cost $.99 each to unlock is a little tacky. I have it installed, and I won't uninstall it, but I probably will wait for it to improve dramatically before picking it up again. In all fairness, if I had a Win 10 tablet, and was sitting in a waiting room somewhere this would probably be a good distraction. Since I have a PC that is relatively powerful however, this edition seems like a step backward.",

Another Issue with the Golems is if they aren't set to defend the village ( Spawn from it ) They like to wander off and not return to defend. and During player Warfare in online mode when it arrives, who doesn't want to build castles and hire guards to help you lay siege to/ defend a castle!

I've even gotten good results on an Atom CPU in a Stream7 tablet by HP. I'd like to see this kind of performance in a version that would interoperate with the Java-based Minecraft.

Second, I can only assume the game runs smoothly because the frames are locked at (what I can only guess at because there is no way to access a counter) substantially below 60 frames with no option to turn it up. Third is the fact that pc players are not going to play something in which they have to pay for texture packs or skins when they can just as easily do so for free in the other version.

Many times, I have found things like buildings, trees, ect. not rendering in for a while. Finally, the lack of hitmarkers is a huge problem. The closest thing to a hitmarker, is a blood splatter. It is realistic, but there is a few things they need to fix. Overall, this is a great game for being in game preview. After a few fixes are made, this will be a amazing game.

Less frequently (at least 1/5 of matches in my experience) but consistently, a lot of players still experience the entire game crashing. I am updating from 2 of 5 stars to 3 of 5 for the moment.

The first and most obvious issue is the Frame Rate. A match usually starts off with really bad FPS that averages at around 15 or so smoothing out a minute after you land on the ground. This can get pretty annoying and can cause one to get killed and lose. The other being the poor latency and crashes. You can be hiding behind a tree, boulder, or a corner of a building and still get shot and every now and then, the game will instantly crash leaving you to be a sitting duck. I get that PUBG is in Game Preview but first impressions matter especially when they're going against Fortnite which is FREE. 3/5",

A bundle including a game that is incomplete and riddled with bugs and performance issues. The average consumer is unaware the game is in as incomplete a state as it is, which is why the game receives about as many complaints as it does compliments. As often stated, PUBG suffers from pretty poor optimization, causing inconsistent framerate (often dropping very low), lag and rubberbanding, and general graphical bugs. Couple this with buggy physics and a strange control scheme, often made worse by the other problems and recurring input lag. All these issues aside, I still play and enjoy the game. I would however highly recommend the PC version over this any day.",

No matter how good your internet is you will lag at some point, i generally do a lot. The beginning is the worst about lagging which is bad because that's when you need to loot fast. As far as crashing goes I've played around 25 matches and have only crashed once and got right back in since i was in a house, but again I'm playing on the one x. The game also has a problem with hit detection which is why you can swear you shot someone but nothing happened. I can forgive crashes and lag due to early access but i can't forgive not having the option to play private matches. Before anyone shouts early access, full pc version came out recently and only some streamers have the option to create them. Why 3 stars then? gameplay is adrenaline pumping especially if you make top 10",

That being said, it was fun while it lasted but like they say \"All things must come to an end\". And if PUBG has issues running on an XB1X, which has 12GB GDDR5 Memory and a faster CPU/GPU, then I hope Sony fans don't get their hopes up... Lol! The PS4 Pro runs on 8GB GDDR5 Memory with a slower and less powerful CPU/GPU, so for those whose thinking it's going to run better... It's NOT!!! The standard PS4 will run the same as the XB1S, with all of the same exact problems. However, I was really hoping that Bluehole and Microsoft was going to stick together, but my hopes for PUBG remaining an Xbox Exclusive for consoles, was a let down and a huge disappointment for me! I hope Microsoft releases a BR Xbox Exclusive. \ud83e\udd1e",

This game has a way to kick you in the butt, its like the Darksouls of shooters. The biggest problems are the broken patches and low frame rates, 60fps should be standard, and 30fps at the least. I don't know maybe you devs should build an all new game engine for 60fps. Just an idea",

        "body": "Ok, so I'm gonna be completely honest here. I have pretty bad internet and this game still runs honestly smoother than I though it was gonna run! I've only encountered a few problems with little lag spikes sometimes and some rendering issues when you first drop into the map, other than that, a few black screens that dashboarded me (but most times you can load back in if you're quick), clunky controls (which I got used to so now they aren't bad), the game is fun as'f! Now the game is still in early access, I know, but It has a good system setup with plenty of cousomization and loot to find on the battlefield, plus loot crates you can purchase to customize your character more! The gitches it has will be sorted soon I'm sure but like I said, not that many I've had a problem with. I'm enjoying the game a ton as it is so I'm excited to see this game progress with updates/content over the coming months! Thanks and PEACE \ud83d\udd25",

The good - PUBG is a great game to play solo, or with friends providing amazing replay value. The skill ceiling is nearly limitless always allowing for the player to improve and polish their skills. The slow paced, strategic gameplay allows for players to play the way they want whether it be passive or hyper aggressive. Personally I love that each game can play out so much differently than the last allowing for unique experiences every time. The bad - 30 fps, small bugs/glitches, aiming will require hours of game play to adjust to if you are used to games with aim assist (COD,Halo,overwatch). The slow roll out of PC updates to Xbox, and (in my opinion) the biggest drawback is no crossplay. overall I love the game and have supported since Alpha I look forward to everything they have in store!",

Graphically, it's more realistic. Although textures on older consoles look blurry more often, and the 'Inventory screen' has no character. I do enjoy that i can explore most buildings. And audio is accurate for weapon shots, etc. Although it's hard to hear footsteps unless you turn volume high on Headphones. My biggest complaint is the loot and MTs. You will get the same pair of shoes, 100+ times. Your motivation to play, is hopes of something good for once. But now, in a game you already paid for. You have paid event passes like Fortnite. Unlike Fortnite, you can't earn G-Points for playing. So you WILL have to buy the pass, or be stuck with the basic 'Free' rewards. It's fun, just needs better rewards",

Solo mode is alright up until you hit the top 20, then everyone is just driving around trying to get a splatter kill. I payed $30 for PUBG, not an updated buggier version of Carmegeddon. The game still has loads of potential, but as of right now, save yourself some time and frustration, and buy a different game. PUBG needs time to develop further.",

I've played most of the available preview games available on the xbox, several costing less money, that are far more polished than PUBG. Hopefully the money made from the not so subtle cash grab port goes towards the game that so many people are supporting. It could easily be a 4 or 5 star game if some more time goes into it. 1992 graphics and single digit frame rates aside, this game is oodles of fun. Also, stop selling $5 cosmetic items and maybe focus on fixing the game instead.",

The one thing I would like to see added in is a starcard system like Starwars it would be fantastic new gameplay features that everyone would like. Now i know what you are thinking why did i give it a one star well that's because this game is the only star in my heart.",

Make sure you uninstall and then 'fresh install' after every single game update. I've played PUBG nearly every single day since December 2017 and have not lost hope on it. Have some patience you crybabies, they ARE fixing it, even if they do sometimes seem a bit handicapped. As of June 28th 2018, PUBG on original Xbox One with wired connection, (if you use wifi then everything is your own fault), is in a much better state of playability, but that does not go without saying that the frame rate needs to be improved to 30fps or preferably better (please give us 60fps), and any or all of the lag spikes need that may be remaining need to be smoothed out.

Speaking of the servers, they are pretty frequently down (like today), or having maitenance being done which is pretty frustrating for a game that has no campaign and is almost completely multiplayer only. All that said, I will be playing this game until those servers crash completely or are turned off because I only hate all the server issues because it prevents me from being able to play more.",

I also want them to fix the ranking system because i was playing with my friends and lost connection to the r6 servers and when i rejoined my game i lost the match and lost two ranks because it counted some for \"leaving\" the match and the loss. I know its in beta but it shouldnt do that to me. Also even with the new update there is actually still some bad hit registration because i headshotted a guy 3 times chest shotted him 6 times but nothing happened even after my friend shot him 5 more times in the chest. It's a good game but they should fix some of this. They also need to fix the teamkilling banning system because if someone is trolling you can only kill them once otherwise you get banned",

Matchmaking can also be very frustrating with re joining games you quit or getting stuck at an loading screen and then having to restart the game. 3 years later they still have not fixed these issues and are consentrating more on adding free and paid content instead of fixing the core game first.

The one thing I find annoying are the teamkillers, sometime I accidental teamkill and get a 1 day or 30 min ban.

Another thing I like about the game is if you are frustrated at Multiplayer or want to have fun, you can play Terrorist Hunt with your friends. The things I don't like about this game is team killing especially when im trying to do something and teamates get in the way and you accidentally kill them or accidentally destroy their gadgets witch they might get mad and kill you. Another thing I don't like this makes sense but, is if someone chooses a operator you want to be, you can't be that operator for the round. Besides the things I don't like, its pretty worth the money if you ask me.",
